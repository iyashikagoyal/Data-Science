I joined a couple of coworkers at Farmhouse for a Sunday night dinner earlier this winter and I think I'm still full. The restaurant itself is cozy, servers were flannel-clad, and our server in particular was a sweetheart. She was genuinely jazzed about the menu and their farm-to-table approach.We started with a round of cheese curds, and this Wisconsin girl approves. They're my preferred style of battered instead of breaded. Melty, chewy, delicious all around. For my entree I chose the Roasted Half Chicken, in part because it comes with glazed Brussels sprouts, carrots, and parsnips on a bed of mashed potatoes. No problem eating all my veggies with that combo! The chicken was moist and tender and a large portion, even for a half chicken. I felt bad leaving so much on my plate, but there was just no way I was going to finish in one sitting. Prices were a little high, but not ridiculous for the quality and quantity. The fare is similar to what my hometown excels at, so I don't know if Farmhouse would be at the top of my list on the next visit, but I also wouldn't be upset if someone suggested it.",4.0,5,4,2

Make a reservation as it is always, always busy here, especially at dinner and then sit back and enjoy.It's all fresh food with a farm-to-table feel. Not everything is a winner, but the things that are, like the cheese curds or the duck schnitzel, are damn to die for. The menu rotates often so what is on there today may mot be on there tomorrow. It is, I think, a tad bit overpriced. Whenever I go, I am always a little shocked by the cost. But, it is a lot of food and delicious food, so you do get what you pay for. I just know if it was even a little bit cheaper, I'd be there more often.However, they clearly don't need me there all the time, as I mentioned, they're packed.

Service was so attentive, and prices were overall reasonable (although looking at the drinks seemed to be a little pricy).

There is a large selection of craft beers to drink and great classic cocktails. We had a salad that was pretty good. It was nothing special. We also ordered the fries with garlic mayo and the duck schnitzel. Both were good. We also had the Brussel sprouts they were browned and quite nice.

We had made a reservation for 8pm on a Saturday and when we got there it was extremely busy/packed. The hostess told us our table wasn't ready yet so we grabbed a couple drinks at the bar. It ended up being about 10-15 min past our reservation time by the time we got seated. So if you're going during a busy time/day, definitely make reservations. I can't imagine what the wait would have been if we didn't have one! The interior is super cute with (shocking) a farmhouse vibe with farm stuff all over. We were seated in the upper level. The Restaurant Week menu choices all looked great but ended up picking the cheese curds to start, roasted half chicken, and the warm apple crisp for dessert. Let me just tell you, THE CHEESE CURDS ARE BOMB. I would go back just for those alone. The chicken was delicious and tender as well with mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts plus some other veggies. I was only planning on having a couple bites of the warm apple crisp because I was so full but ate the whole thing because it was so good...whoops!Super delicious food! Was a little disappointed we still had to wait with reservations and our food did take a while to come out, but it was very busy in there plus our server was very helpful and friendly.

I ended up just ubering into downtown to save the trouble.Location: Literally located in an alley, make sure to ask around or you might miss it. On busy nights, you'll see the long line in the alley. Most likely it's for Three Dots and a Dash.Reservations/Wait: You can make reservations with them to skip the line. However, despite the length, it does run pretty fast. My group of 5 were able to be inside within 15 minutes of waiting.Bar: Since is underground, it is extremely stuffy and warm. I recommend to wear light layers underneath otherwise you'd be suffocating. There's seating, but most of them are reserved. The bar area is where most people would stand and since it's crowded, it's a little hard to squeeze through for drinks. However, people are pretty courteous and will let you pass through. Drinks: They have a good selection of pretty drinks. The strongest drinks will have skull icons to indicate, generally it would have 2 skulls beside its name. Most of the drinks are about $11- $14, which is reasonably priced, since they're also decorated very nicely with little umbrellas, or even tiny flowers. You're also paying for the art. I ended up getting the Swizzle, which is one of their strongest. My friends ordered their other drinks, which were definitely less strong, but still strong enough to give you a good buzz. My bartender was very patient with us, he had to tend to at least 3 other groups, so our drinks did take awhile but he did not rush on making them quality drinks. Overall experience here was great, the drinks were strong and definitely left my group and I in a really good mood.

We came after a concert at HOB, but this time I made a reservation to avoid the overcrowded bar. I'm glad I made one because it was definitely still packed on a Thursday evening. I was also able to better enjoy Three Dots' ambience. It's actually pretty nice. Since we had a table, we tried the: *Anaconda Don't Want None (Blanco Tequila, Mezcal, Lime, Fassionola, Falernum, Bitters) - I really liked this one! But, I am a tequila/mezcal fan. *Port Light (Bonded Bourbon, Overproof Jamaican Rum, Passion Fruit, Pomegranate and Lemon - Serves 2-3 - $40) - Didn't see any other tables order this (the conch and the zombie seem like the most popular table drinks) but I'm glad we did. It is a bit on the sweeter side (versus the Anaconda at least) but no overpowering cinnamon!  *Captain Dino's Pu Pu Platter - generally pretty impressed with this, but now I know what I WILL order a la cart next time -- Coco's Coconut Shrimp, Thai Fried Chicken & King Crab Rangoons. The Yuca fries were just too starchy for me - just a fact of yuca, nothing against Three Dots' version. The egg rolls were bland and I actually used the (vegan) dipping sauce from the yuca fries to add some flavor. It also seemed like OK etiquette to just order drinks, so don't feel shy making a rez for just drinks! 47/365",3.0,3,2,2

This is not a bar for the timid or passive. It is a bar for $16 tiki drinkies with names like Painkiller, Stripped and Go Naked, Time Traveler, and Aloha Felicia. Each is unique and super sweet, but with enough kick to eventually get you to a state where tiki is cool and so is your drink. Hell, maybe even you will be, too.The crowd was definitely older, but filled with people who were there on a mission to get their drank on and get it on quick ... tiki-style. I fit right in.

And as my friend mentioned prior, the cocktails were indeed well presented and strong.I tried the 151 Swizzle (151 Proof Demerara Rum, Lime, Cane Sugar, Bitters, Nutmeg, Absinthe) and the Jet Pilot (Aged Jamaican Rum, Overproof Rum, Cinnamon, Falernum, Grapfruit, Lime, Bitters, Absinthe). I was very impressed with both but the Jet Pilot was extra delicious and lethal...lol :)  My friend got the Pandan Pain Killer (Jamaican Pot Still Rum, Barbados Rum, Coconut Tangerine, Pineapple, Pandan).

The rum was much more refined than what I remember for Bacardi 151 during my college days. It was well balanced with the incorporation of lime, cane sugar, bitters, and nutmeg in a complex composition that could take some thought to wrap your head around. Although it didn't taste too overwhelming, it was nice and strong.The boo got the Basic Batida ($14). Yes, it's pumpkin flavored (with pumpkin Overproof rum), yes it comes in a pumpkin-shaped mug that looks basic, and yes I teased boo for being basic. While the drink was interesting, crafty, and strong, I found it too sweet with the Boston Buol Madeira, the dulce de leche, and the coffee armagnac.The presentation is stellar, with aesthetic flairs like fresh orchids and whole cinnamon sticks. Equally memorable is the ambiance, which surpasses any of my tiki bar experiences in SF. The soothing green lighting, faux dried grass roofs, wooden totem poles, and centerpieces of sand and seashells seem excessive when you think about it, but they all add to the magic of this tropical oasis.Fun facts: - (Important conversation-starter fact): The name is the morse code for V, symbolizing victory. Their namesake drink was created by a WWII veteran, and their vision is to create a space to celebrate life's victories. - The menu includes bowl drinks for larger groups and a selection of southeast Asian-inspired bar bites like coconut shrimp. - For the drunchies, Firecakes around the corner has amazing donuts and is open until midnight Thursdays through Saturday.- If you are a true fan, you can purchase the cup to bring home.

The hostess looked perplexed but I told her were were just here for a pre-dinner drink and the bar area is fine--she said that was probably the best bet for tonight.  And when we entered, I saw that every table was taken as well as every seat at the bar but there was quite a bit of standing room left.  So it was pretty easy to order at the bar.  An hour later though, it was pretty packed. We tried the Missionary's Downfall and the Pandan Pain Killer.  Both fruity delicious and artfully made. Missionary is made with liquid nitrogen to ice it and it was fun to watch the bar get that magical mist.

There is a coat check, but we were only staying for one pre-dinner drink. Our time there was just enough to enjoy the scenery--very tiki and fun.

Once you're inside, you immediately get the Tiki bar vibe - the flowers, skulls, blue lights, etc. Their drinks are pricey...as most cocktail drinks are, so don't be surprised. But they have some creative drinks on their menu that are a lot of fun! I ordered their three dots and a dash drink; beware, it is STRONGGGG. like all the rum they put in it definitely is prominent. I think I got through 75% of my drink. (Thankfully, I had food just before, so I didn't really feel too much of the alcohol, but don't take this drink lightly!) One of my friends ordered their Pandan pain killer, which was nice and sweet. They also have options to get group drinks where they come in huge creative containers (like skulls or fish bowls, etc.) We were able to thankfully get a table for 4 girls, despite not having a reservation. Considering how busy this place gets though, I don't think it would hurt to have one on hand. Overall, I think it's a great place for a stop on a bar crawl or a girl's night out.

Plus the background music choice is amazing. The jazz music gives just  the right vibe. You can choose this for your special celebration as well. I think the table next to us is celebrating birthday. And the waiter presents them with an ice cream with a firecracker on top. You can clearly see the smile on their face. Now back to the food...The bread is amazing!!! It's actually the best sourdough I've ever found in Chicago. The crust is crispy but not hard. And the bread itself is a perfect balance between chewy and moist. I even ask our waiter tonight to help me pack some bread home. Our waiter is just so nice hahahah. We start our night by sharing the crab cake. It's easily my favorite dish tonight. You can seriously taste the REAL crab meat in it. And the sauce pairs perfectly with the crab cake. Too bad there's only one piece lol. Moving on to the entree, supposedly the highlight of the night, but my most disappointed part as well. I order petite fillet mignon, cooked to be medium rare. And my boyfriend asks for ribeye cooked to be medium well. The first thing I notice is that the plate is NOT HOT... at most Luke-warm, which is defiant something I expect to see at a restaurant of this price range. And then the steak... I don't even know where to begin. Even under the dim light, I can tell that my steak is over-cooked, resulting in a nearly rubbery taste. And the steak is really blaaaaaaaaaaand. Yes, they do offer steak seasoning, but I thought they would add salt when cooking the steak.Putting the steak aside, the peach sorbet is a great finish for the night. It's so perfectly smooth that I couldn't even believe it's not ice cream. And it's not overly sweet, I can really taste the peach flavor, which is a huge plus for the dessert!Oh and don't forget the drink menu. I try the Pago Pago, which has rum as base, and mixes with pineapple and green chartreuse. It's the first time I've ever tried this. And I'll definitely order this every time I see it on the menu from now on.

This was a good choice. The lower level is definitely more quiet and intimate than the upper level. It feels like you are in a speakeasy, but the part where they hide all of the liquor. It is very dark downstairs, and everything is lit by candles. There's a mixture of couches and booths to sit at. There's a small bar, and the ambient soundtrack helps to set the mood. It is a pretty stark contrast from the upstairs, but the levels complement each other, nonetheless. The service is insanely attentive. The drinks are absolutely delicious-definitely try something with whiskey. I also like their wine policy-if you go you'll see. It's a nice, friendly touch and makes you feel like you are eating dinner among friends. The steak. If you come here and don't get steak, you're doing it wrong. The aged ribeye is definitely one of the best steaks I've ever had. It was cooked and seasoned perfectly. The sides are huge and definitely shareable too.

I also got the Pago Pago, a rum-based cocktail with green chartreuse (a sweet, spicy and pungent liquor that apparently has a completely natural green colour) and pineapple. It was fantastic. Everything was great. The shrimp cocktail was fresh and came with a number of different sauces. We got two crab cakes - a great decision as it was too good to be satisfied with one. Our sides included wild mushrooms, Brussels sprouts and fries with garlic aioli (some of the best damn fries out there). For the main course, I went with the dry aged bone in rib eye. It was delicious, but given the apps and sides that preceded the main course, I couldn't finish the whole thing. Of course, we finished the night out with dessert. They brought out our chocolate cream pie and lemon meringue pie with a flickering sparkle, as the crew sang happy birthday. Go with the chocolate cream!

The crab cake was excellent--it was stuffed with real crab and had a nice, chunky texture with each bite. Each order only came with one crab cake unfortunately. As much as I love crab cake, even I couldn't really justify the price tag...The fried chicken was extremely crispy, but it was also a tad too salty for my taste.

Everyone raves about how great it is that I had to try it for myself. I wanted to go somewhere special for my boyfriend birthday and he wanted Bavettes. We made reservations about a month in advanced because this place is always packed! It was hard getting a reservation at an early time. We came in at around 9 and was asked to sit in the waiting area until our table is ready. The restaurant itself is beautiful. It's very dark and romantic. The waiting area had these comfy couches but we only waited for about 5 minutes. We started off with 2 cocktails which were delicious. I ordered a lillet rosé martini while my boyfriend ordered a sazerac. We were only suppose to order wine because it was a Wednesday but the cocktail menu looked so intriguing. It sort of reminded me of Maudes liquor bar in the west loop. The wine menu was very long and we opted for a red. They also have a BYOB option but I forget the rules for that and I probably should have researched that before coming here because that might be a better/cheaper option. We ordered the steak tartare, baked crab cake, dry aged bone in NY strip, truffle mac and cheese, thick cut bacon, and brussel sprouts. This was a lot of things to order for two people and we had a few leftover sides.Let me start with the appetizers. The baked crab cake is a must! I wish I ordered 2 of them honestly they were so good. It was also a healthy serving. The baked crab cake was blue crab, romoulade , and lemon. It was probably the best crab cake I ever had. The steak tartare was also delicious with dijonnaise, a slow cooked egg on top, and a good helping of bread. There was also bread for the table if you needed more. This was a solid tartare. We split the steak because I usually don't eat more than 6 oz of a steak if I had other things to eat and my boyfriend ate the rest. This steak melts in your mouth it's so good. I kind of wish I had more room in my stomach to eat it all. If you come to Bavettes you have to order the steak! It's completely necessary and you will have no regrets. For the sides the truffle mac and cheese was the best. It was a truffle explosion it was so good! The waiter said that the mac and cheese was his favorite and I think it's the best side we had. The brussel sprouts were alright and I'm not the biggest fan of thick cut bacon because it's so greasy but my boyfriend really enjoyed it.The service here is phenomenal. The people are great and very attentive. We were super full but wanted some sorbet to wash everything down with and it came with a nice little sparkler. I saw a lot of people there celebrating something so this would be a great place for that! I can't wait to come back here!",5.0,7,2,1

I'm a suburbanite-craft beer-and- wine-drinking-low-key-bar kind of gal myself, but I was excited to try a craft cocktail place. The bar itself has a great vibe and look to it. My friend went ahead and made a reservation, which was awesome- we got this cool circular style booth and felt VIP. The menu has food and drink options inspired from around the world. We had just eaten dinner, so we did not sample the food. I chose a Japanese-inspired whiskey cocktail ($13). The base price of the cocktails are about $13 and go up from there. They have a funny little indicator key below each drink to let you know how strong it is (I plan to use the acronym NFA whenever I can now!), so you can plan for how much booze you will actually be drinking. The key also mentions if a drink is smoked, served hot, and the kind of glass you can expect. My drink was strong (listed as so, as well), and decent. I was expecting more flavors than just whiskey though. I felt like the drink fell a little flat on that aspect. Another aspect that fell flat was our service. Our waitress seemed disinterested in us. The fact that we were newbies probably didn't please her. I was on a time crunch to get back to the train but me and another friend were considering a second cocktail. The waitress had come back and asked if we wanted to order another drink and in the time it took for me to look at my friend to confirm ""are you going to get another?"", the waitress had walked away. So essentially $30 of profit was lost on our tab. We took the next chance we had to close out and go.I would come back again, I think this place can be better than what we experienced.",3.0,3,3,2

A lot of people coming here must mean the food is good right?ATMOSPHERE/ARCHITECTURE: 8/10This place has a homey, classic feel to it, utilizing a lot of dark wood to set the ambience. There is always some old Italian movie playing in the background and apparently Al Capone and his crew used to hang around here back in the 1920s/30s. The restaurant is large and has a lot of seating. Easily 150+ and that is a conservative estimate. It was a little bit packed and tight for space in my opinion, but that just means it is doing very well.SERVICE : 3/10They were very busy but that is no excuse for the handful of marred mistakes that were made that were actually pretty big. We had ordered a birthday cake for a friend and it was supposed to come with a candle. No candle. Strike one. I ordered braised pork shank which I will get into later and it said it comes with organic vegetables. No vegetables. Strike two. And lastly, one our friends was struck with a bill double what it should have been at the end. Luckily she was immediately take aback and asked about it before realizing it was a mistake and it was a double charge, but this is a pretty grave mistake. Strike three.FOOD: 8/10Braised Pork Shank - First off, WHERE were the organic vegetables?! I would have entirely forgotten about this until someone at my table mentioned that it was supposed to come with some organic vegetables. Disappointed. However, the braised pork shank is FANTASTIC. The meat is cooked to perfect tenderness so that it falls off the bone and melts in your mouth. The flavor is really perfect to me. Not too salty. Some might find it a bit bland but I think it was seasoned exactly as I wanted. HIGHLY recommended. Just ask for the vegetables next time.D'Anitra Pizze - Pizza with duck prosciutto which is cured in house with onion and wild agugula. The pizza overall was really good. Very authentic Italian style pizza that is different from a lot of the Americanized offerings in Chicago.Pouilly-Fuisse White Wine - Very smooth clear tasting wine that had a little tartness to it. I thought this was a very good white wine and good choice for someone who wants something a little sweeter and lighter.Gavi DOCG del Comune White Wine - Very similar to the Pouilly-Fuisse except with less tartness and also less sweetness. I thought it was good was well but preferred the Pouilly-Fuisse over this one.PROBABILITY OF RETURN: 6/10I would definitely consider returning here to try other food options.

We had reservations for 6:00 pm, and right when we walked in, our table was ready for us. Quartino looks and feels exactly how you'd expect an Italian/pizzeria-like place to look.

My boyfriend splurged and ordered an entire bottle of wine for the two of us anyway, so that wasn't really going to be a problem anyway. But I digress.We ordered quite a bit of things to share, because what you order comes in smaller plates. This included eggplant parmesan and a delicious kale salad.

It has a nice homemade texture and inconsistency in size, which I adore. Just love it- Calamari is also seasoned well and good, but Carmine's is better. Quartino's calamari is thicker in consistency and denser in wash. Both are soft! But Carmine's is heavenly soft and light. You will feel fat after Quartino's calamari (I still like it!)Cons:- Inconsistent, and the chef has been changing every year or so. And I notice the difference in taste, especially with the tagliatelle- AWFUL ordering-out policy. We like to order out. They have an early cut-off time to order out, and if you need to order out after this time, their first answer will always be no. You'll have to request a manager to override this (it can be done). Makes no sense to me---I generally prefer Carmine's, but Quartino's has longer hours. Also, Quartino's tagliatelle is my favorite in Chicago (and 2nd favorite calamari).

Service was generally very good, and I think three people stopped by our table to make sure everything was to our liking.  But, for some reason, the great service stumbled when we ordered dessert.

To give credit where it is due, our server proactively noted the lengthy delay and apologized, but were about ready to cancel our dessert order by the time it arrived. (Once there, dessert was tasty.

Both were freshly prepared, flavorful and filling.Service all the while was polite, friendly and attentive.We moved on to a beautiful salmon filet with a unique glaze.

I'm a suburbanite-craft beer-and- wine-drinking-low-key-bar kind of gal myself, but I was excited to try a craft cocktail place. The bar itself has a great vibe and look to it. My friend went ahead and made a reservation, which was awesome- we got this cool circular style booth and felt VIP. The menu has food and drink options inspired from around the world. We had just eaten dinner, so we did not sample the food. I chose a Japanese-inspired whiskey cocktail ($13). The base price of the cocktails are about $13 and go up from there. They have a funny little indicator key below each drink to let you know how strong it is (I plan to use the acronym NFA whenever I can now!), so you can plan for how much booze you will actually be drinking. The key also mentions if a drink is smoked, served hot, and the kind of glass you can expect. My drink was strong (listed as so, as well), and decent. I was expecting more flavors than just whiskey though. I felt like the drink fell a little flat on that aspect. Another aspect that fell flat was our service. Our waitress seemed disinterested in us. The fact that we were newbies probably didn't please her. I was on a time crunch to get back to the train but me and another friend were considering a second cocktail. The waitress had come back and asked if we wanted to order another drink and in the time it took for me to look at my friend to confirm ""are you going to get another?"", the waitress had walked away. So essentially $30 of profit was lost on our tab. We took the next chance we had to close out and go.I would come back again, I think this place can be better than what we experienced.",3.0,3,3,2

Decided while we were having a glass of wine that a little bite to eat would be nice. I asked our bartender, who by the way is a terrific person, if we could order a charcuterie. I asked to add a couple pieces of cheese as well and could he ask the chef if he could make that for us? He said of course. Well guess what, the chef said no- he would not do that! Let me set this up: there were maybe 10 people in the entire restaurant and the chef said ""I don't have time to to put this together for you"". So my review is two stars out of five, due to a DIVA chef! The chef is a diva, great restaurant but bad chef = 2 stars !",2.0,0,0,0

Live music plays during brunch, boats drift by screaming & blasting music and great views of the skyscrapers.So the hostesses here are pretty terrible. They let a line of 10 people form while someone in the front looked over a menu to possibly order take out. Um, what? There are two of you, ask them to step to the side and help everyone else. This went on for about five minutes, everyone in line was getting frustrated and I finally went up to say I'm just looking for my friends, can I go find them? Really pretty terrible at handling situations and also they didn't say bye or thanks to anyone in my group when we left. Totally my pet peeve with restaurant hosts.Our server was much better in terms of attentiveness & knowing her stuff, but I felt like I was being sold a used car, kept trying to add things in and a bit too much pressure in the ordering. So service here, could use a little work.The bloody mary ($15)  is insane at River Roast! You get a skewer full of meats, cheeses and peppers in their spicy concoction. The scotch egg ($8) was pretty darn good. I think the best part of the entire meal actually. Well, we also got a side of Nueske Bacon ($5) and I mean, you can't go wrong with Nueske. Thick, delicious and done well.The golden gobbets ($10) were deep fried chicken bits and came with a little glass jar of honey. The chicken was mostly deep fried pieces and not much meat. The chicken was seasoned, but honestly not enough so. This dish sounded so great in theory but fell short for us.With a name like RIver Roast, we were required to try something roasted, of course! We had the roast beef cooked medium rare and were happy with it. It wasn't mind blowing but just good enough. It came with potato croquettes which were also good, but not amazing.River Roast is a great place for alfresco brunch on a beautiful day, but honestly you need go in knowing you'll spend some dough for just okay food & service.

The chicken was perfectly fried and the interior was juicy. The honey added a nice touch.For the main course, we ordered the Rack of Pork along with the Supper Club Mushrooms, Asparagus, and Curried Cauliflower as sides. The pork was way overcooked. It was dry and had a sour taste that made it very difficult to eat. The sides were all decent, but they were nothing spectacular.If it wasn't for the discount that we received, this dinner would definitely not be worth it at all. Even with the discount, I still don't think it was worth the price. The main course, the pork, was just so lackluster that it will probably deter me from coming here again in the future.

We went to Sushi-San on a Sunday night and had to wait for our food for more than 30 minutes. Our waitress came to apologize for the backed-up kitchen twice during the meal.We ordered the King Crab Dy-No-Mite, Japanese Sweet Potato tempura, D-Luxe Nigiri, Spicy Kalbi Skewer, Melted Tomato Nigiri and Japanese breakfast pancake. Other than the sweet potato tempura, everything comes in small portion. King Crab Dy-No-Mite was delicious! But the sushi was design to have King Crab sitting on top of cucumber. However, the king crab fell off the cucumber many times (thankfully on the plate instead of the table) when I tried to pick it up. Having about 30 years' of experience using chopsticks, I'd say this sushi is a little difficult to eat. Japanese Sweet Potato isn't soft itself. When it was made for tempura, it became kinda hard and dry. It is an okay dish, but I am not a huge fan of it.D-Luxe Nigiri was the one we waited about 30 mins for, but was finished in 2 minutes. There were 12 pieces of nigiri for $45. The flavor was good, and the fish was fresh. However, given such a long wait, I can't really enjoy the food but just quickly swallowing it to comfort my upset stomach. Side note to the wait, we were fed with two dishes of ginger...Spicy Kalbi Skewer tasted really good! Very soft Kalbi with tasty sauce. However, $10 for one skewer is not something I will go back and try another time.Melted tomato Nigiri is a very sad dish.

It has been a hot spot since it first opened a few weeks ago, and rightfully so.Management and ownership classifies this vibe as ""sushi and hip hop."" Staying true to the theme, when we visited, they were playing R&B and rap bops from the 80s and 90s with modern day hits mixed in.Sushi-San is another notch on the Lettuce Entertain You belt, which means it has everything it needs to succeed. The interior of the space is a replica of Ramen-San. It is very open and very loud. It is very hip and I think it will succeed in that location for this reason.In terms of the food, the sushi items were mainly hits although there were a couple misses. If you're not a sushi fan, this isn't the time to experiment with bluefin tuna...it was VERY fishy. However, the uni and roe bite was incredible. My other favorite was the amberjack. When ordering, I highly suggest the San Set. The platter just makes the most sense.Practically everything we received from the grill was perfection. ESPECIALLY the Togarashi Fried Chicken. You HAVE to order this when you stop in. Thank me later.The desserts are also strong. The Japanese pancakes were magical. So fluffy, moist, buttery, maplely, but unique thanks to the matcha. They melt in your mouth. Service here was spot on! We were greeted and thanked for stopping in as we entered and exited the restaurant. The wait staff were personable and fun (also good looking). Quick with refills. One thing I would say that bothered me is they didn't REALLY know which fish was which. THIS annoyed me because I had so many questions.

The vibe is identical to Ramen-San, with the light colored wood and the hip-hop soundtrack. I like that they're offering simple and good quality sushi at a casual level, and none of the spicy mayo eel sauce cream cheese filled disasters of the trendy sushi spots of today.The nigiri/sashimi is where they shine, as long as Kaze Chan is behind the sushi counter. Fish is at perfect temperature, and ratio of rice to fish is good.My other favorite is the maitake mushroom tempura. Perfectly fried, that tempura batter tastes so good with the umami of the mushroom. If you like fried pickles, get the tempura kimchi pickles.For appetizers, we tried the Tako Taco, which comes in three, each a light tempura batter-fried nori shell filled with spicy octopus. The shell tastes like a cross between a corn chip and crispy salmon skin, but had a weird aftertaste. If you've ever had the tacos at En Hakkore 2.0, they do a better nori shell. The Otoro Nest, which is basically chopped Otoro held by a delicate fried ""nest"" which in theory would be delicious but was just ok as well. The Shrimp Toast is basically wasabi tossed shrimp on a shrimp chip, not the triangle shaped deep fried shrimp roasts that you might be more familiar with.The DIY handrolls are a deal at $27 for 3 different kinds of chopped sushi (tuna, salmon, yellowtail), accoutrements like scallions and avocado (the avocado portion is like $5 right there), pickled cucumbers, and pretty much unlimited rice and nori.  I though the fish had too much white pepper and gave my feedback to the owner when he came around asking how everything was (shout out to Amarit! He's a friendly guy.)The Golden Katsu Nuggets are deep fried pork served over rice in a sizzling bowl. It is very savory and sweet, almost teriyaki-like with a bit of yuzu.The Tokyo Char Dog is a little grilled wiener (heh-heh) in a bao taco, comes in two. It's a nice little bite.I love that they have Hamachi Kama (grilled yellowtail collar) on the menu. This is a great deal for $10. I also like that they keep it classic -- just grilled with salt and pepper. If you've never had it, definitely try it! It may look daunting but once you break into the flaky meat inside and dip it in the ponzu sauce with radish and yuzu, you will wonder why you haven't been eating this all your life. I could just eat this and rice and call it a day.The La-Croixing Tiger is a nice refreshing summery drink and will make you feel you're not in the middle of a cold, cold winter. I want to cut the tops off of all my La Croix cans and use them as cups now.For dessert we've tried the black sesame cheesecake, Lychee Emochi (fun mochi ice cream with emoji, and the Japanese Breakfast which is the super fluffy pancakes (you might recognize on Insta, but they were def not as fluffy as the ones on Insta) with matcha butter and black sugar syrup.  They were all ok, nothing amazing.They also have a bar where you only get handrolls, 3 for $21.

We also got some of the box sets of sushi including the Mr Maguro and the D-Luxe Nigiri. The Mr Maguro is really an amazing presentation of highest quality tuna - note that the fatty tuna is already lightly salted and there is a faint brushing of soy sauce on some of the other tuna so the only pieces that (optionally) require any additional soy sauce are the tuna maki roll. Our favorite piece of nigiri for the night (which we ordered more of to finish out the night) was the lightly seared Chu-toro Tuna that came in the D-Luxe Nigiri set.  My coworker said it was the best sushi he has had in Chicago!",5.0,4,2,1

My friend ordered it and said I had to try some. I could eat this dish alone for the rest of my life. It was so amazing! We both couldn't stop gushing about it all night. The sweet potato is cut into thing slices and very soft, while the tempura batter is extremely light but with a bit of crunch to it. The combination is divine.

We really enjoyed the jalapeño tuna maki- it was rolled in cucumber and was a crisp and refreshing alternative to plain old spicy tuna rolls. We also got the pork belly and Vietnamese pork and both had great flavor. The kimchi was also one of the best I have ever had. The emotchi was fun and inventive mochi dessert with interesting flavors. The food was expensive and served small tapas style. The food items ranged in price from 8-13 dollars and we needed to get 6 main items and 1 dessert before feeling full. The drink menu was very pricey with most drinks costing around $13.

The food here isn't bad & to be honest it's actually pretty good but it did live up to the expectation that I perceived it to be prior to coming here. The ""Japanese ol fashioned"" was extremely smooth however the alcohol content must've been light because the cocktail lacked the ""bite"" I've known most old fashions to have. The ""shrimp toast"" was okay, nothing to write home about. In closing, the ""A5 Kagoshima"" was a nice cut of steak however it can't hold a candle to my top 3 places for wagyu in the city.

To be honest I wasn't paying much attention to what the differences were, I believe the summer school rolls are wrapped with cucumber? The nigiri was good, the rolls not so much. They also served their hot sake in a mug. Kitschy and not into it. If I had to come back here it would be for the nigiri if nothing else. The night we came in the kitchen was backed up, or so we were told repeatedly by the staff with apologies. That's fine, but once we had our food the quality of the rolls we're lackluster at best, especially compared to other great sushi spots around the city. The staff was great.

Next the pork belly was perfectly crisp and savory. The pear and beet/radish (? not sure which) on the side was bright and refreshing. Finally the rotisserie chicken was nice too, a large portion for a small plate, the chicken was juicy and tender - although the bed of vegetables they all kind of tasted similar besides the onion. My mother thought most of the dishes were far too salty, but to me just the risotto was on the saltier side (although I liked it).The honey pie was pretty good as well, I really liked the whipped cream that came with, it wasn't too sweet. The grapes that came with were really disgusting though to my dismay. I don't know what was wrong with them, but they almost tasted unripe or bad... not sure which so I ate one and just left them. The crust was nice and flakey and the pie had a nice taste although I can't say the taste accented the honey too well, it was just sweet and sugary.

The hummus was flavorful and the bread they bring out with it is like crack. The cheese was also so fresh and the tomatoes that came with it were delicious.

The spread sampler is a good option to try a variety, but be aware the portion size was smaller than expected (though the spreads were so dense and heavy that it seemed like a fair portion in hindsight).As for the other items, the butternut squash risotto was delicious, buttery, and filling. Lamb & beef kefta was pretty standard and although tasty, nothing worth raving about. However, the lamb shakshuka turned out to be a disappointment. The consistency was too watery and oily and perhaps not baked enough. I dipped the pita bread into the sauce but it was so hard to absorb. It seemed like they were trying to skimp out on using tomatoes by watering it down. The shredded lamb was fine, but each bite I took had too much oil and not enough tomato sauce.",4.0,3,4,0

Our server was helpful in explaining that generally, 2-3 plates pp would be good but that the brunch plates are a bit larger so that one would probably be enough. What we got was a good amount. Even the avocado toast was pretty sizeable. Overall, I enjoyed the food, but certainly not phenomenal, especially at the price points. The chicken was tasty but a tad salty. The hummus itself was forgettable, but the mushroom topping was very enjoyable, along with the charred eggplant. The highlight probably was their house bread - it had the perfect texture. I also really enjoyed my tea and that they had a good offering to begin with. What was nice was that they brought out their frozen greek yogurt with a candle for my birthday. This looked very appetizing and it was. It was also quite a bit so we were able to share.Overall, the service was very good.

While there was no tables available for an hour, the bar luckily had seating for the two of us! Score! Note: definitely put in a reservation ahead if you plan to come.Anyhow, this second time around I think I can say that Ema is definitely growing on me. We tried the basmati & beluga lentil salad, charred eggplant (essentially baba ganoush), the pan roasted romanesque cauliflower, grilled chicken kebabs and the rotisserie chicken. Each dish I'd say had a unique delicateness to it and you could tell each ingredient was intentionally picked out to compliment the dish as a whole. My favorites of the night would definitely be the charred eggplant and grilled chicken kebab. The house pita bread goes excellent with the eggplant. And that the zhoug sauce on the side of the kebab... absolutely yums with the tender & moist chicken kebab.

Of the spreads, my favorites were the Labneh and the simple Garlic Hummus. The Labneh was wonderfully creamy and had just the perfect amount of sweetness with the honey added. I also liked the addition of crunchy almonds; the pita bread that went with the spreads were delicious as well. The Clafoutis was extremely fluffy--it wasn't your typical brunch pancake. Normally, I don't really like to eat pork belly since it's too fatty for my taste, but the pork belly here had the perfect balance of lean meat and fat. It was wonderfully grilled and actually tasted pretty good with the pita bread.

Intricate flavors of feel good food that any meat eater would also get a craving for.  Each dish was a bit of a surprise.  I knew I shouldn't have eaten so much of that ridiculously good flat bread. I just couldn't help. I ate it anyway and was stuffed. We tried the eggplant hummus good and I normally do not like eggplant spreads, the beets (very good), the butternut squash risotto (very good), the potatoes (not nearly as good as the other options but only because the other options were above and beyond good), and the bf had a kebab (he even liked the vegetarian options more than the meat- they were that good).SERVICE - The BF must have mentioned we were dining for our anniversary because every staff member mentioned it. The manager came out and talked to us and when we said we told our server we were too full for dessert, they brought out the Greek custard anyway on the house as an ""anniversary treat"". ENVIRONMENT - more casual than I would have anticipated. The bright interior seems to be a beacon for a more respectable chill crowd than what's often found in River North. There's no crying girlfriends. No drunk stumbling bros. Instead there were just normal even keeled people. There were even kids dining in the restaurant which is something I feel like I don't see often.  Jeans are more than ok here. PRICING - not the cheapest place but pretty moderately priced for the area. The food quality was worth it. OVERALL - we specifically hadn't tried this place before because its located in the bottom of a hotel. Don't let that scare you away. This is definitely not a hotel restaurant.

Beautiful bay windows and easy to hear your company. No Kesha on loud-speaker here. :)I'll get to the good stuff; below is a line up of what we ordered. Check it out for yourself soon; you won't be disappointed. Coffee: Freshly roasted, small cups, frequent refills, high-end cream Seasonal Vegetable Salad: Who knew a salad could be so tasty? We loved this. Ribbons of fresh veggies (cabbage & carrots), crisp lettuce and bites of rye crisps made this an enjoyable opener to the meal.Potato Pancake: This is simple, classic and a must-try. Not enough for a meal, a breakfast appetizer if you will. Presentation is adorable (can I say that about a pancake?!). There are little dollops of apple-sauce and sour-cream, nicely seasoned. Pork Schnitzel Sandwich: This was HUGE and so fresh. Pork was fried to perfection, and filling. A really inventive approach to brunch, would come back here just for this. From start, to finish Bohemian House nailed it with the little details and I can't wait to go back. Service was attentive and personable.",5.0,0,1,0

I am normally not a huge fan of mustard seeds but it worked harmoniously with the fried pork.

Yum! You absolutely cannot go to a Czech restaurant without at least sampling the beer. We then switched over to a red wine, and started ordering food. For an appetizer, we had the Hungarian Langos, which are a standard street food in Hungary. They were so delicious! For our main course, I had the Potato Pierogi (from the starters) and my brother had the Czech Roasted Duck Leg. The entree sizes are not huge, so I recommend an appetizer if you are looking for a longer, more filling meal.

Also, a percentage of the dinner goes towards supporting a creative non-profit which was a great selling point for me. We made a reservation for 2 on a Tuesday and were seated quickly with the option to start the 5 course prix fixe at our choosing. The first course was fried broccoli dish with a strong flavor generated by South Asian pickles (good but likely bold for many). The second course was braised veal cheek (my favorite dish) with a corn pudding. The third course was an escargot based parsley rigatoni (I felt the fennel was strong). The fourth course was a substitute (from pork belly) vegetable dish based on carrots and figs. As the staff noted we had not cleared out one dish, they offered to give us any other dish we wanted, as they wanted us to love each course and after some hesitation, we asked for one of my favorites: the short rib pierogis. Combined with the guest chef, Justin, coming over to greet us and chat with my wife and I, we were impressed by the service. For the final course, we had butter cake with peach and butterscotch and an oatmeal cookie with black pepper buttermilk ice cream (really interesting taste). Finally, we were provided small coffee cakes for the next day as a parting treat. Overall, I really enjoyed the guest chef collaborative experience and thought the integrated charitable cause was creative and neat. I'm looking forward to what else the series presents!",4.0,0,0,2

I didn't want to complain again, so I ordered extra noodles to take home and asked for a to-go container. I figured it would be better if i re-prepared it at home. Also the rice for the rice plate was too wet and soggy. The chicken was dry and lacking flavor. 0/5Husband ordered the shiitake ramen which was tasty. Broth was was flavorful and hot.

The menu features a range of millennials' favorite Asian food, including several types of ramen ranging from vegetarian shiitake to the epic Sumo Bowl with wontons, as well as a handful of baos. The dessert of hot donuts with creme anglaise is popular too and looks uniquely beignet-style. They even have okonomiyaki for weekend brunch and late night fried rice for the drunchies.The boo got the Tonkotsu, which contained all the essentials (in terms of eating as well as photographing) of chashu pork, half molten egg, scallion, and seaweed. For $14 it's on the pricier side though within the range I'm used to for more upscale ramen. - The portions are also rather impressive, starring 3 generous slabs of melt-in-your-mouth spice-rubbed pork belly- While the molten egg had the right consistency, I would have liked it steeped in sauce like traditional ajitama- Noodles are the wavy egg-based type and had a decently springy texture- Tonkotsu broth was well done, with prominent pork flavors but not too salty or thickI was enticed by the Special of the night, which our server described as carnitas style pork with scallions in tonkotsu broth. The mystery price tag turned out to be $15, which was quite reasonable. Although the concept of combining carnitas with ramen is interesting, the pork wasn't the soft guilty-pleasure pulled pork that I was expecting but rather a dried jerky-like take. I appreciate the novelty, but in my opinion it was less than practical since it was very chewy and the dried pork wasn't ideal for soaking up broth. Despite my initial disapproval of the fusion-like elements, I did enjoy the hip ambiance which made the place feel very alive. The dim lighting is cool (though possibly not the best for food pictures), and the tall communal wooden tables add street food vibes as a nod to the origins of ramen.",4.0,7,3,3

An egg should always come with a miso ramen and it was only half an egg. My broth was decent and the ramen was decent but not for $16. My friend had the lunch set with steak and tonkotsu. The rice was mushy and there was way too much sauce. The broth in the ramen was not warm enough for a cold day. Also the pork was dry. We got the creme puff and donuts. The donuts were amazing and the creme puff was okay. It could use a bit of sugar and also the filling was not evenly allocated. Most of the creme puff is the puff and not the filling.We paid for the tab and the waitress never returned with our change and also did not offer to box up our remaining dessert.

The worst thing is when you ask about an item and they don't know, but this guy clearly knew his stuff.

In most circumstances, I this would have docked some points, but I didn't mind the wait at all that day.FOOD: 8/10I ordered the kimchi fried chicken ramen and it was quite good. It is definitely spicy and has a strong kick in the beginning. The broth is flavorful but not too salty. The fried chicken in the ramen was soft and slightly crispy. For the noodles, they were soft but not mush and held their texture well. As far as negatives, maybe there was too much sesame in the broth but it wasn't a big deal for me. I think that $16 for a bowl of ramen though is on the pricy side though.PROBABILITY OF RETURN: 8/10The ramen was good enough to warrant me trying other dishes.TO EAT OR NOT TO EAT: It's worth eating.

I always get the Tonkotsu. The broth is SO rich, has tons of flavor, and isn't too salty. The pork actually melts in your mouth. The egg is always perfectly molten. The noodles are nice and firm and tasty. I've also tried the matcha creme puff, matcha ice cream, and the hot donuts. The matcha creme puff was visually interesting because it was HUGE and is aesthetically pleasing, but the taste was kind of disappointing because the outside was a little burnt. The creme inside was pretty good though! The matcha ice cream was just alright. Too expensive for the portion. And the hot donuts... so good! The creme they serve it with is so sweet and velvety. I always share these with a friend though, because I'm usually too full to eat them all after my ramen.Last thing: I came here one time with a friend and the server told us about the special of the day, which was some kind of Tonkotsu with fried chashu and an extra rich broth (how could they make it more rich than it already was?)

My friend and I both got the traditional Tonkotsu, and for each bowl you can add in a meat (tofu, extra pork, fries chicken) or other add- on's. I opted for the Tofu and spicy sesame chile oil. We decided to get the Chinese broccoli as a side. Also I was impressed at their cocktail list- limited but looked creative. I got the penicillin while my partner got the hibiki old fashioned. Drinks came out quickly- the penicillin was light, refreshing, perfect amount of lemon and ginger and the whiskey was smooth. Cute little toothpick sword with a sugar cube on the end to stir with my fidgety hands. Old fashioned tasted no different than a usual old fashioned. Ramen emerges 10 minutes later on individual trays. Looks pretty, presentation is appealing. I take a mandatory photo, mis it up, and dive in. Broth tastes wonderful, not too salty or fatty, perfect amount of spice and garlic for me. Large slices of pork, wavy noodles are al dente, and the egg certainly looks molten. Every bite is delicious. It's exactly what I needed on a freezing day. Portions are huge- I, nor my large male partner, could finish our bowls.  The broccoli also was delicious.Unclear if one of the staff meant to dress like a ninja, but he did, and we loved it. In sum- definitely go here. Trendy but not crowded, fun music, delicious savory soup, filling portions for an appropriate price point. And if you like to Imbibe, please go for the penicillin, it certainly made my runny nose go away!",5.0,0,0,0

The place was packed for a Saturday night, which was expected since it's located in River North. It was pretty loud and they played hip hop music in the background. Also, this is a Lettuce Entertain You Restaurant. I ordered the raw tuna as an appetizer. I thought it was pretty good and I enjoyed the avocado in it. For my entree, I ended up getting the ramen that was on special. I can't remember the name of it, but it had pork in it and a pork broth. I thought it was pretty good. This is the second time I have had gourmet ramen and I thought it was on par with Wasabi, which is the other place I have had. Ramen-San is actually pretty well priced for Chicago and not overly expensive. Our service was very good. Our waitress checked in multiple times to refill drinks and water.

It's got a muted yet lit feel -- a little showy and self aware like an Instagram eyebrow, and much like an Instagram eyebrow, it doesn't come cheap. So, to start the tale of the night, I got a whiskey connoisseur ticket for me and fellow drinker/eater. We divided each drink up with each course. The drinks were: Glenrothes Bourbon Barrel Reserve, Single Malt Scotch: I'm no rah rah whiskey fan, but this one had notes of coconut and vanilla that escaped like grace notes on a piano score. Now I'm getting poetic and that's probably because I'm thinking about this drink. Balblair '99 Single Malt Scotch: So I don't know if I've ever mentioned that I'm no rah rah whiskey fan....but boy....this one stung me like a Hungarian Horntail, and Harry Potter wouldn't stand a chance with this drink either (I don't suppose). It sunk its barbs into my tongue, and I felt like it had a weird, gross taste. Ballechin 11Yr Manzanilla, Single Cask Scotch: I like my eyes smoky....and my whiskies smoky. I learned that when I drank the Manzanilla. More like God-damn-zilla.  Lamb shank: Could have notched it up with flavor but I pressed the ignore button as soon as I felt how tender it was. It practically oozed its way past my fork and into my belly faster than you can say ""lambo-ghini"". Cauliflower tots: Avril Lavigne would probably say ""what the hell...all this place has been is good but now whoa what the hell"" because this one was a little disappointing. The bleu cheese tasted more like ranch than anything else -- I don't know why. The table next to me got the bourbon battered cheese curds and I felt #ragrets looking at it. Short rib: This was truly the star of the show. Spices were on point, as well as the veggies and the potato mash at the bottom. Bobby Flay would have chanted along to the rhythm of mouths chewing (no talking, only sounds of eating) in an exquisite, harmonious symphony. Could John Cage pick this one up?

It's also not very big, but I liked that because it wasn't super super loud in there and I could hear myself talk, although some of the seating is close quarters.I would describe the Franklin Room as a whiskey/cocktail bar. They have a HUGE drink menu that features a ton of obscure/small batch/expensive whiskeys that a connoisseur would surely appreciate. They also have food, mostly sandwiches at around  $15 but also some entree items at $25-30. We opted for 2 cocktails, the Vieux Carre and the Blood & Sand. Both expertly mixed and tasted fantastic. The Vieux Carre was potent and I liked it a lot.We kept it simple and got 2 sandwiches and a dessert for dinner. We had the FR burger and the Cod sandwich. They were both very good! Pricey at about $15 each, this was definitely a very very good burger that was simple in a good way. Super rich, cheesy and cooked to perfect medium, it also came with fries which were delicious as well. I paid the  $3 up charge for truffle fries, which I could taste a difference between the regular fries, but I'm not sure was worth $3.

Our dinner was super straightforward and he did a good job.Overall a really cool spot for cocktails and whiskey, the sandwiches were also very good.

Essentially their spin on an old fashioned, and it was delicious and awesome for $5. And ended up being able to put in one more order just before happy hour finished. Whoop whoop, TURN UP.   For food, we shared short rib poutine ~ braised short rib, beef jus, fries, feta, pickled red onion, and top with some spice for a little kick. The short rib was super tender and had a sort of korean style sort of marinade to it as I recalled and the pickled red onion gave it some freshness. All in all, excellent for sharing. We also shared an order of their Surf & Turf burger ~ wagyu beef patty cooked to perfection, soft shell crab, whiskey balsamic, cheddar, provolone, sunnyside egg, on a pretzel bun. This burger was bangin' and our server Dan even had the chef split it in half on two separate plates with our subbed side salad without us even having to ask.

I thought the portions were appropriate. The steak was very tasty and cooked perfectly. My boyfriend enjoyed his halibut, but the lemon sauce was very sour. Our server, Dan was awesome. He was sure to check up on us but wasn't intrusive or too pushy. Overall, I was very happy with my experience and would definitely love to come again.",5.0,1,1,0

I've had many things on the menu.. some of my top favorites- truffle garlic bread, both pizzas (pepperoni and the truffle mushroom) Bucatini, gnocchi, the meatballs, and chicken Parmesan. Aside from the great food, the service is one of the best. Bobby and Travis are great waiters. I recommend requesting them when you make a RSVP. They always go above and beyond to ensure a great experience at the restaurant. But you really can't go wrong with any of their waitstaff- everyone has always been attentive and given great service. Also, whenever I make reservations, I always request the same booth and 95% of the time, my request is met...Customer service is great at RPM. Back to the food.. the dessert. The Budino is probably one of my all time favorite desserts from any restaurant. They just came out with a new dessert with grapefruit at the bottom, whipped cream, and a tropical sorbet on top. It's light and refreshing. Very good after a carb filled meal..(I just don't know the name of it)Lastly, the drinks- great cocktails and a great wine list.

""It's the best Italian you'll ever have,"" they said, ""you won't regret it!"" they praised. After visiting RPM Italian, I know there are some bandwagons that aren't worth jumping on.I can't say it was all bad. As soon as you walk in the restaurant is beautiful and bustling with life. The round sofa tables were gorgeous and made for a cozy dining experience. Once you get to the real reason you're there - the food, disappointment ensues. We started off our night with an order of meatballs and truffled garlic bread. The meatballs were tender and the sauce it was in had the right balance of savory with a hint of sweet. By far these two items were the winner of the night. We followed up the appetizers with the Proscuitto Tortelloni and Handmade Cavatelli....Now. Anyone who cooks knows you don't always get it right. The chef that night got it completely wrong. The beautiful presentation belied the taste. These two dishes were so brackish I had to down gulps of water after each bite. In the Proscuitto Tortelloni, the rosemary and salt were fighting a losing battle for top flavor as the dish was overloaded with both. To make matters worse, the pasta was not cooked. The Handmade Cavatelli was not any better. We couldn't get past the salt.We thought the night could be redeemed with dessert. We ordered the RPM Cheesecake which was topped with blueberries.

It was a tiny table on the edge of the upper level room, pretty much on the steps. When we sat down, people who were leaving had to walk around us. We were pretty much a fire hazard lol. But we asked for another table and all was well.     The highlights were the starters. We loved the Black truffle Beef Tartare, Prime Rib Meat balls, and Tuna Bruschetta! The entrees took a step back.  My veal Parmesan was tasty but pretty basic, it came with some plain spaghetti and marinara.Things got a little better with the cavatelli, and dessert. The food was good, but  I expected more from ""RPM"". This is deff not on the same level as RPM Steak.   The place is beautiful, the vibe and service are great.  Although I feel that there are alot better options for Italian food in Chicago, but RPM has a swanky elegance and style of their own.

The pasta is homemade, dense, and perfectly al dente. I've never had pasta as good as theirs. The sauce is simple but really yummy!

They greeted us, wished me a happy birthday, and asked if we had visited before. This set the tone for the meal!The Atmosphere: is chic - a lot of black and white and well lit (perfect for food pictures!). You can definitely bring larger groups here, but you will need a reservation.The Service: our server was Ryan S and I found him to be nothing but professional. He was very helpful in explaining the menu (since it was our first time), and let us know ahead of time that he would bring our order out in 2 courses. We were debating as to whether to order more food or not in the beginning, as they advise you to share. With that information, Ryan told us that if at any point we wanted to add anything to please let him know. Between courses, they changed out our plates and I noticed that they meticulously wiped any spots of food that had been left on the table. I appreciated the time and care that they took in ensuring that we had a good experience. It's the little things like that that set restaurants above the rest.The Food: I LOVED the Prime Beef Meatballs ($12)! They melted in your mouth and there was plenty of red sauce for me to spoon over the top of them. They were seasoned perfectly and I appreciated the fresh herbs on top. We paired the meatballs with the Truffled Garlic Bread ($8). I liked how crispy the bread was and the truffle added an extra layer to the dish. I ate both the meatball and the bread together - using the bread to wipe up the leftover meatball sauce. The combination of flavors and textures was delicious! I was more full than I had anticipated after the first two dishes.Our second round was the lobster ravioli and the Spicy King Crab pasta. The Lobster Ravioli ($18) was a smaller dish (6 raviolis) but packed a punch. The pasta was al dente, the lobster was fresh, and the sauce was buttery and had a great flavor to it. We inhaled this!The Spicy King Crab pasta ($17) had delicious, fresh pieces of crab in the dish. I loved the flavor of the pasta! My boyfriend wasn't as fond of the texture, as he said it stuck to his teeth. It was a fun dish to try since I've never had squid ink pasta.At the end, they brought out two mini gelato ice creams with a candle and a happy birthday sign. The mini gelato cones were so cute!!

It was served on top of two slices of toasted baguettes sandwiched in melted cheese. Basically fireworks in your mouth. Highly recommend!Burruta: The miniature mozzerella balls were breaded and fried and topped with an olive garnish and basil leaf. Garlic Bread with Truffle: The bread was crispy and toasted to perfection, however I couldn't taste much of the garlic. The flavor of it resembled cheez-it crackers. Cauliflower: Slightly charred on the top, the aroma of it was amazing. There was finely diced red peppers and a sauce as the bed for the cauliflower, however this made the lpcauliflower itself bland. I actually had to salt it before eating. The flavor of the dish was actually in the sauteed red peppers that I think should have been incorporated with the cauliflower. Bucatini with Meatball: The meatball was an extra couple dollars but worth it. It was tender and seasoned well. The sauce in the pasta made the dish absolutely divine with hints of garlic and basil.

Loved the decor and setup of the place walking in--a good balance of natural and indoor lighting. This place is kind of pricey for brunch, with nothing really under $15. They had a seasonal menu for truffle items where the chef would come over and personally shave truffles over your plate of food. I ordered the Eggs Benedict because I was attracted to the pesto hollandaise sauce--it was good, but wished there was a little more pesto flavor to it and that the ham was less salty. The eggs were perfectly poached and the brioche well toasted though! Highlight of the place: There were 2. The Monkey Bread we shared as a table was absolutely delicious.

They have lots of pasta on the list, and great meats like osso buco. I was hoping for more red meat (beef) options. They had osso buco, lamb chops, pork chops, and the tasting menu had a filet, but i like meat and was hoping for another steak option. In terms of cocktails ($14) they're great and a good portion, but expensive. I also had the tiramisu which came with espresso meringue cookies and they tasted like cotton candy! It was delicious.

However, Siena Tavern has the ability to fix these issues for future customers. First of all, our party of 6 was squeezed into a booth that could have seated 4 people comfortably. Hubby said he felt like he was sitting in the middle seat on a plane. We asked if we could be seated at a table, but, the table we pointed to was reserved for another group. In addition to the cramped seating conditions, we were subjected to blinding lights from the garage across the street. Although this is not Siena's fault, Siena should install shades for the comfort of their customers. Despite the tight seating arrangements and the inconvenience of getting up every time someone had to use the bathroom, the food was pretty good. Some of the  dishes that stood out: burrata, pizza, orecchiette pasta, squid ink linguine.

Honestly, my friend and I looked at each other kind of shocked that the place was so busy on a Wednesday night. But after the meal we both realized why it was. The food was excellent, fun vibe, and the drinks were flowin. The Sangria was really tasty, not too sweet but sweet enough. Favorite dishes: The Coccoli appetizer - recommended by our server and so thankful she did. The dough was crisp yet had some nice chew, the cheese was stretchy, prosciutto salty good, and the truffle honey added just a hint of sweetness to the party in my mouth. Highly recommend. Bombolini Dessert - I'm not a big dessert guy but these Bombolinis are f&ckin awesome. It's basically a light and fluffy donut. The interesting thing is that it's potato based. You have your choice of filling as well which you inject yourself via squeeze bottles into the bombolini or on top or on the side or directly into your mouth or wherever the heck you want. Meh dishes: We got the Squid Ink Linguine and Spaghetti. Both pastas were good. Nothing amazing for the price point though. Wagyu Beef Meatball was good but once again for the price point nothing amazing. I would certainly go back if entertaining a group of friends.

As it is, the $$$ can easily be $$$$ depending on what you eat. But enough complaining...it was a good place. Waiting for our third party, we sat in the bar and started with drinks. The bar is a beautiful large oval with seats all around...many face outward looking through large plate-glass windows giving a gorgeous view. The room also has high tables around the edges so the bar area holds a lot of people. Nice venue to meet and greet. The liquor was the usual...the mixed drinks sounded pretty creative. My $$$ comment earlier referred to a $15 Johnnie Walker Black on the rocks...two drinks and you bought the bottle at home. The Margarita was too tart, the Bloody Mary was very nice, and the Disaronno Sour was perfect. Three drinks (we returned the Margarita) and a glass of wine for dinner with bar tip brought us to $75...so this is where they make their money.In the dining room we had: the Gnocchi (5 stars for the pasta as it was creamy and puffy, but the rating gets knocked down to 4 because the included fried sage was not a good addition and there just wasn't enough of the wonderful pancetta), the Carne Pizza (5 stars and really the best of show...with all the meat on top the crust sagged a bit but that was  expected), the Tagliatelle (3-4 stars and very nice but some of the mushrooms were too crunchy). For dessert: the Chocolate Cake (4 star good but a small serving if you are sharing) and the Gelato (3 star good but unremarkable). Service was on and off...in the bar it was on...attentive and ready to please; in the dining room it was off...more lackadaisical and inattentive. The floor manager did pass by so that is a good thing. All in all the dining room was very noisy...you practically had to shout at your dining mates, but everyone seemed to be having a good time.

It's a very lively environment when it's hopping; the dining area is not a bad size, but the bar occupies about half the space...not a bad thing! It's a nice bar. :) Service was fantastic. This was my first time, so the our waitress gave me a tour of the menu, and she made some great recommendations on drinks. She was clearly very knowledgeable of the menu. She was also very attentive throughout the meal without bothering us in any way. The courses were well-timed, and everything came out quickly. Ordered the #33 on the cocktail menu; it's their take an old fashioned. It was good! It boasts a gingerbread simple syrup and apple cider in addition to the bitters. It was a bit sweet for my liking, but all around a very smooth and balanced drink. (I had two of them, so I can't complain. )Food was great! Better than I expected. Their claim to fame is that everything is made from scratch; it tastes homemade, but they're beautifully refined dishes! We started with the grilled octopus, which was nicely cooked for the most part. Some of the pieces were a little over-cooked, but they had a nice char. The sauce it came in was very light and tart...good contrast to the octopus.For my main course, I had the short rib ravioli. Wow, really really good! Pasta was beautifully-cooked, and wasn't overdone. The short rib filling was a decent portion, and had a very nice flavor. The mushroom sauce was very rich, and it also had a hearty taste, and a little sweetness to it. All in all, I really enjoyed it; my only issue was that there was a bit too much of the sauce. It drowned the flavor of the ravioli a bit. Otherwise, really great dish! My dinner companion has the gnocchi, which she really enjoyed. For dessert, we had a bit of an eyes bigger than our stomachs complex, that being said, I regret nothing! We ordered the bomboloni, which were delicious, and a pretty sizable order (4)! Comparable to a State fair donut--but better. They came with three really good sauces (raspberry, hazelnut and caramel for dipping). We also split a gelato flight (donuts and ice cream for dessert! Weeee!) the gelato was excellent!! My favorite by far was the brown butter peanut. Really rich, and it had chopped peanuts in it. Ordered cookies and cream, salted caramel and creme brûlée. All very good, but the peanut is a must! All in all, great experience! Would have been 5 stars if not for the wee missteps with the ravioli being over-sauced. They're quite pricey, too! Pasta starts around $19 a dish, and meat entrees started at $30, but averaged about $45.I would definitely come back, but this is more of a special occasion place.",4.0,2,1,1

I have tried multiple things on the menu and I am amazed at how delicious the food is every time. I have never had a bad experience here, reservation or not.Starting with the tasty appetizers, I literally dream about their burrata it has this unique tomato jam that I can't get enough of. Their bruschetta was very good as welI. I usually start off with their meat and cheese platters. It seems a little pricey but it is so worth it, especially the chef's selection of meats and cheeses. I haven't had a chance to try their salads yet but from the looks of it, they seem great too. Next is Pizzas: Never would I ever expect to love pears on a pizza, and I am usually pretty adventurous but this prosciutto pear roasted garlic cream pizza was phenomenal! The cinque formaggi pizza and the margarita are also good but the prosciutto pear really wins when it comes to pizza here!Pastas: Hands down my all time favorite pasta in the city has to be their perfectly executed pappardelle pasta! I never imagined something so simple could taste so amazing. The best gnocchi I've ever had is also at this restaurant and I can't get enough of the addition of the pancetta. Their orecchiette pasta was also good but I'd rather order something from the items above over this. Dessert: The famous bomboloni! It comes in a group of four bombos with three different sauce/custard flavors. I really enjoyed these more than the ones at Bombobar/Bar Siena as they are smaller and came nice and hot. Their gelatos are also good, with a large selection of flavors. I love monkey bread and was happy to see that they have a delicious one here. I liked their caramel cookie jar was tasty but i'm not a huge caramel fan so it is just based on preference.Drinks: I have loved every single drink I have ever ordered here but my absolute favorite is their No. 29  (belvedere, prosecco, grapefruit, lemon, mint, strawberry).

The food is naturally delightful, the setting is dreamy and the tiramisu - one of my favorite desserts - might be the best I have had. Italian wine selections are nice as well. Major High Points:1. The pasta dishes here are out of this world, all the ingredients are fresh and cooked to perfection2. Service is awesome, our waiter provided us with insight on the menu and left us alone without letting us wonder where he went3. Did I mention the tiramisu?A couple minor flukes:1. Made a reservation here at least a month in advance. The entry of the restaurant is a bar setting, while the main restaurant is in the back. The waitress attempts to sit us at the worst bar table available, next to the cashier...Absolute no way. She later kindly sat us in a nice booth. 2. If you order a bread, please know the waitress will pour a cup (not joking) of butter all over it at the table without asking. This left the bread greasy, and a bit over the top for me and my SO.

Then we had the fried calamari with peppers which was fantastic, probably one of the best I've had in a long time and I'm a huge calamari lover and they did it right. For our entree we split the cacio e pepe which was unbelievably delicious and fresh. They sure know how to make their italian food. We honestly were pretty stuffed but decided to try the semifreddo dessert and omg, why have I never had this mousse almost ice cream like dessert before. Wow delicious, and I had asked for some extra chocolate sauce on the side and they did it right. I honestly if I'm in river north and want italian food, this will be my new go to place and I'm super happy they are a lettuce entertainment establishment as well!",5.0,4,2,3

It is a lettuce entertain you restaurant so the quality food and service are generally on par. The décor is modern rustic...I like the light hangings.

I was good portion but it was just heavy with pasta and not so well distributed cheese. -I would pass on the Gnocchi Bolognese - not too impressed. -chocolate molten cake - I think it had nutella in it...it was decent but not awesome. -Service was odd. The waiter was a curt with us and seemed to not hear what we were really saying. Example of convo: me: ""so what is popular dish on the menu? or what would you recommend?"" waiter: ""okay. i'll give you are more time"" and he abruptly walks away. This sort of convo happened again later... Overall, it was a good time and everything we ordered was very sharable for 3 people. we still had leftovers.

I'd never heard about this place, but we got really lucky at a fundraiser for a cat shelter we support and happened to win dinner vouchers for a number of Lettuce Entertain You restaurants, including here. The atmosphere is great, trendy, but comfy with low lighting and bottles hanging from the ceiling. They were playing old school 50s music and while I could hear my husband fine, it was sometimes hard to hear our more softly spoken waitress, but it was ok because I already knew what I was ordering from all my yelp investigation beforehand!We ordered the roasted artichoke and grilled calamari appetizers... both were great! The calamari was perfectly grilled, not rubbery at all and were the whole squid instead of sliced which I appreciated. The artichoke was a really great starter, covered with parmesan (mmm), great to share and not something you'll get at many places.For mains I had the spicy scampi pasta with gluten free pasta. The gluten free pasta is not listed on the menu (or not very obviously), but I had seen on Yelp that they offered this, you can swap out the gluten free fettuccine for any pasta dish. I have to say it was easily the best gluten free pasta I have ever eaten, ever so slightly al dente and you would never have known it was gluten free! Amazing! And the sauce was spot on with plenty of pretty big shrimp! My Hubby got the Linguine & white clam sauce which he thoroughly enjoyed. The sauce was on the thin side, but we used his spoon and slurped up every drop!I had mentioned on the Open Table reservation that dinner was an early bday dinner for my husband and so after dinner they brought out a serve of vanilla icecream with a candle which was a nice touch and then we also ordered the tiramisu and coffee... a lovely way to end an evening.So with 3 courses each including 2 sodas and coffee the bill came to $92 (incl tax, excluding tip). Very reasonable for a great dinner.

It was definitely packed inside and we were likely only able to get seating because we had made prior reservations. Good sign. A lot of people coming here must mean the food is good right?ATMOSPHERE/ARCHITECTURE: 8/10This place has a homey, classic feel to it, utilizing a lot of dark wood to set the ambience. There is always some old Italian movie playing in the background and apparently Al Capone and his crew used to hang around here back in the 1920s/30s. The restaurant is large and has a lot of seating. Easily 150+ and that is a conservative estimate. It was a little bit packed and tight for space in my opinion, but that just means it is doing very well.SERVICE : 3/10They were very busy but that is no excuse for the handful of marred mistakes that were made that were actually pretty big. We had ordered a birthday cake for a friend and it was supposed to come with a candle. No candle. Strike one. I ordered braised pork shank which I will get into later and it said it comes with organic vegetables. No vegetables. Strike two. And lastly, one our friends was struck with a bill double what it should have been at the end. Luckily she was immediately take aback and asked about it before realizing it was a mistake and it was a double charge, but this is a pretty grave mistake. Strike three.FOOD: 8/10Braised Pork Shank - First off, WHERE were the organic vegetables?! I would have entirely forgotten about this until someone at my table mentioned that it was supposed to come with some organic vegetables. Disappointed. However, the braised pork shank is FANTASTIC. The meat is cooked to perfect tenderness so that it falls off the bone and melts in your mouth. The flavor is really perfect to me. Not too salty. Some might find it a bit bland but I think it was seasoned exactly as I wanted. HIGHLY recommended. Just ask for the vegetables next time.D'Anitra Pizze - Pizza with duck prosciutto which is cured in house with onion and wild agugula. The pizza overall was really good. Very authentic Italian style pizza that is different from a lot of the Americanized offerings in Chicago.Pouilly-Fuisse White Wine - Very smooth clear tasting wine that had a little tartness to it. I thought this was a very good white wine and good choice for someone who wants something a little sweeter and lighter.Gavi DOCG del Comune White Wine - Very similar to the Pouilly-Fuisse except with less tartness and also less sweetness. I thought it was good was well but preferred the Pouilly-Fuisse over this one.PROBABILITY OF RETURN: 6/10I would definitely consider returning here to try other food options.

Italian food is already fancy, but Italian food tapas-style is a whole new level of impressive. I had dinner here with my boyfriend and his family on a Sunday night (actually, to meet my boyfriend's family for the first time. IT WENT WELL, FOLKS!!!). We had reservations for 6:00 pm, and right when we walked in, our table was ready for us. Quartino looks and feels exactly how you'd expect an Italian/pizzeria-like place to look. Except it's more upscale than your average pizzeria. I didn't catch our waitress's name, but she had what she herself described as ""bold red""-colored hair, she was informative about the menu, and made sure we always had water and that our glasses were never half-empty when it came to wine. My boyfriend splurged and ordered an entire bottle of wine for the two of us anyway, so that wasn't really going to be a problem anyway. But I digress.We ordered quite a bit of things to share, because what you order comes in smaller plates. This included eggplant parmesan and a delicious kale salad. I'm not going to lie, there were a lot of other things ordered to share, but Quartino has good wine... which affected my memory ever-so-slightly. But I do remember being pleased with it all! We each also got our own meals as well, and I ordered tortellini, which was SO great. The plate was lined with prosciutto, for heck's sake!

So even if it's busy, you may get lucky with little or no wait time.  The food is comforting and delicious for just the right price! I specifically love the goat cheese ricotta served with warm toasted bread, the penne a la vodka and any of their pizzas. They also offer heavier main dishes, meats, cheeses and salads. The menu is designed to share so it's perfect for girlfriends or date night. We usually get about three things for two people and are satisfied.  Then comes the wine. It's divided into 1/4, 1/2 and full liters and at a good price. A 1/4 liter is about a standard glass and a half ranging from $9-14. Not a bad price at all!

It has a nice homemade texture and inconsistency in size, which I adore. Just love it- Calamari is also seasoned well and good, but Carmine's is better. Quartino's calamari is thicker in consistency and denser in wash. Both are soft! But Carmine's is heavenly soft and light. You will feel fat after Quartino's calamari (I still like it!)Cons:- Inconsistent, and the chef has been changing every year or so. And I notice the difference in taste, especially with the tagliatelle- AWFUL ordering-out policy. We like to order out. They have an early cut-off time to order out, and if you need to order out after this time, their first answer will always be no. You'll have to request a manager to override this (it can be done). Makes no sense to me---I generally prefer Carmine's, but Quartino's has longer hours. Also, Quartino's tagliatelle is my favorite in Chicago (and 2nd favorite calamari).

To give credit where it is due, our server proactively noted the lengthy delay and apologized, but were about ready to cancel our dessert order by the time it arrived. (Once there, dessert was tasty.

This time around, we were truly blown away by the service and the quality of food.My favorite dishes were definitely the Fried Dimsum Platter, the Char Siu Wonton Lamian, and the Lunar Blossom.The Fried Dimsum Platter contained 2x Pumpkin Puffs, 2x Crispy Wontons, and 2x Spring Rolls. It was hard picking out one as my favorite because all three were so unique, so I would just recommend getting two of each kind. You won't be disappointed with any of them.The Char Siu and Wonton Lamian was a marked improvement over the bowl of lamian I had two weeks ago. Just as before, the hand-pulled noodles were very firm and chewy. This time around however, the bok choy was actually really good and the soup was umami.The Lunar Blossom was the most extravagant desert I've ever had and something that I've previously only seen on Facebook videos. Basically, its piece of cake topped with gelatto inside of a white chocolate shell that blossoms open when your server pours hot dark chocolate on it. The presentation and taste blew me away.We will definitely be back for more.",5.0,1,0,0

I was so excited because I've heard such great things. And I will say, the food did not disappoint. It was very cool to see the chefs pulling the Lamian noodles, and all of our dishes were great. Now, here's the bad part. The second we walked in, our host started leading us to our table... when I slipped on the floor and fell extremely hard on my knee. The floor is made of a very slippery material to begin with, and there was some kind of liquid that I fell into. Everyone sitting around us gasped, but NONE of the staff- including our host- stopped to help me up or see if I was okay. Our host stopped in his tracks, looked at me, and then turned around and kept walking!!! I could hardly walk and was using the nearby tables to pull myself along. My husband and I almost left right then, but we were celebrating my birthday and I wanted to stay. Our waitress came over immediately and asked what we wanted to order. My husband said ""my wife just fell, can we have 5-10 minutes to look at the menu?"" Our waitress huffed in annoyance (!!) and turned around and left. She didn't come back for 20 minutes, and we placed our order. I also asked if she could bring me some ice (which she never did). The manager came over about a half hour into our meal and said ""I heard you had a fall! Please let me know if there's anything I can do."" No apology, nothing. I again asked for ice, he said ""right away!"" and never came back. Our waitress continued to be cold and borderline rude, and she brought our drinks halfway through the meal, rather than at the beginning. At the end of the evening I expected to see some item comped (just in good faith, you know?), or an extra treat brought out. Nope. Not once a single apology or assistance. Turns out I tore my posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) in the fall. Thanks, Imperial Lamian. I won't be back.",2.0,0,0,0

I ordered some tea, 2 appetizers (steamed basket and fried platter), and a bowl of beef brisket noodles. All items were sub-par. The beef brisket noodles lacked flavor - from both the brisket and the broth. Texture-wise, the beef was very dry and the noodles seemed to fall apart very easily, as if they were not freshly cooked. Considering it was $16, the toppings were also very sparse - pretty much just a few greens and some cilantro. I'm willing to pay more in this type of setting, but perhaps not twice the price for half the usual quality. The appetizers were a bit finicky - they looked really cute, but everything lacked substance. Portions were pretty small for $12 each. The spring rolls were sparsely filled with veggies and almost everything lacked flavor (even the dipping sauces!).

I've walked past this place hundreds of times but finally decided to stop by and to get out of the rain.Service wasn't the best. Waitress forgot my order after taking it and forgot sauce for my appetizer. I asked for a drink with a slight modification and she told me it couldn't be done. Huh? Then she considered the possibility of modifying if I had an allergy. Huh? I think using a simple syrup instead of a flavored syrup shouldn't be a big deal. I guess she reconciled it in her mind after much introspection, then brought it out by the time I had finished my appetizer and was midway through my meal. She apologized for that and that's cool, but I'm still uncertain why she was being weird in the first place.Mixed Mushroom Lamian was OK. Is it miso broth? Is it veggie tomato broth? Is it both?

I remembered from a Facebook video that there was a rainbow soup dumpling place in Chicago so I had to use Google to find this place.Their XLB were so juicy but I think the experience of eating them was probably my favorite. Say you order something from a restaurant--it's most likely a large portion of the same things. For this, each bite is something different and you get to experience these unique flavors. Although a bit pricey ($12 for 6), I think it was well worth it for the experience. Keep in mind that it will not fill most people up.The flavors--gruyere cheese, duck, traditional Shanghai pork, truffle, spicy Szechuan​, and crab--were pretty spot on of what it was supposed to be. The gruyere cheese was surprisingly​ good and not a bad combination at all.The pumpkin puff, which is butternut squash and duck, wasn't all that great and I could have done without it.I think because I like to excite my taste buds but also because they were actually very tasty, it was a 5-star experience in my book!",5.0,1,1,1

""Happy Lunar New Year!"" I'm here to pay up! Excellent addition to the neighborhood with a beautiful space and an open kitchen so you can see where the noodle-magic happens. Was seated in the very back room on the first visit and felt a little more like Chinatown, as in darker, crowded and noisy. The feel in the main dining and bar area is fresher and I'd go so far to describe it as ""elevating"" with the abacus-like iron-work around the booths, the large windows, and the gorgeous mural in the bar area. The food follows the design...elevated Chinese food and I lean toward five stars when I think about those xiao long bao (soup dumplings), specially my go-to gruyere. Like a little pocket of French onion soup but richer than most & easier to consume, really. I can't get away from the pumpkin puff dim sum either, especially on chilly days. Roast duck and butternut squash filled pumpkins is wonderful when the wind whips and the frost nips. The gailan (Chinese broccoli) is delicious too....soy glazed with roasted garlic and ginger jus. You can't go wrong with hand-pulled noodles or try the salmon wok dish. Divine!! I've got to get around to tying the jasmine-tea smoked ribs. The service is where I can't surrender the fifth star. It's good but not always. Or, I've sat next to tables that have had issue on their order.

I appreciated that Gerardo not only walked us through everything but was teaching us so much history about the drinks, Imperial Lamian, as well as getting personal with us too.The reason I appreciated the drink selection was that I'm not much of a whiskey drinker, simply because I didn't know HOW to drink it (I can't order drinks neat.

I also truly loved the Imperial Lamian version of ""shrimp toast"". And the highlight of our experience was the cute little piggy bao! So cute, but not TOO cute to NOT eat.

Very little soup for XLB, the crab one didn't taste like crab; the Szechuan peppercorn one had some spice but otherwise was just pork.

Pork belly la Mian: this was good, but nothing to write home about. $14 for a bowl of soup, one of their cheaper dining options. Their pandan cake globe dessert is hefty priced at $15.

You won't be able to eat the white chocolate shell, it is too sweet. Just eat the vanilla ice cream with chocolate syrup and pandan.

The only thing was the xiao long baos stuck together and it was extremely difficult to pull them apart without ripping them. The vegetable wok fried lamian was good. Basically your standard stir fried noodles. No complaints there.The cumin lamb was delicious. Tender pieces of lamb with a not too strong cumin sauce. Definitely one of my favorites. The duck fried rice was disappointing. The rice was too sticky yet slightly dry. The duck was good, but the dish itself was way too salty. Definitely tasted like a lot of soy sauce. The winter club was good. I love gin and this cocktail also had egg white so it was a-ok in my book. Lastly we got salted egg yolk buns on the house because it was my birthday and OMG were they so so good. Definitely the best part of the meal. Overall, this place was good. Some of the items were better off not trying, but it's not too bad. The prices were great compared to a lot of places around.

We sat outside on the patio which was cute with overhead twinkle lights and lots of sunshine. The inside was cool too, kind of a punk rock, classical Italian decor mashup.

The spritzes are refreshing, tasty, and strong (if you have a low tolerance like me). We split a ricotta toast, truffle tagliolini, and bolognese potatoes. The toast was amazing with truffle oil deepening the light, whipped ricotta. The tagliolini was good, though could have used some kick or cheese.

A lot of Italian restaurants can be too stuffy for my taste, and many spots in river north (hit or miss) pretentious depending on the crowd  y'all know EXACTLY what I'm talking about. But Bar Lupo gives off fun vibes with some awesome, kinda funky decor. It also feels more like a neighborhood joint, tucked away on a side street rather than on a main strip. Upon arrival, we were surprised to find barely anyone else there (on a Sunday night). So even without reservations, we were seated quickly at a table with plenty of space to spare. My friend and I ordered a bottle of pinot grigio to start, which we were both pleased with.

Happy hour is good here with a pretty good selection of wines, beers and 3 spritz. The spritzer (I got the App App Spritz) and it did not disappoint. Would definitely go back for happy hour and some starters. Food was solid. For 6 people we got 2 plates of crispy meatballs and 1 dish of the Brussels sprouts and was the perfect amount of starters. The Brussels sprout were amazing. Sprouts were charred to perfection with some pancetta and then topped with fresh sprouts and then sprinkled with honey and pine nuts. I'd say the brussel sprouts was the shining dish for everyone.  I got the tangliolini and it was good. I think the pasta was a bit tough for my liking but taste was great. The rest of my party had the Lipo Chicken Parm (sans buns), the Roasted .5 chicken and the Pork Sugo. All were tasty and filling dishes.

Over the past couple of months I'd been getting emails from Bar Lupo and filed this away as a spot to check out. It was the most recent email (they are a sponsor of River North's Art Gallery Walk) that drew me in on an unseasonably cool summer Friday. My plan was to have a drink and a bite to eat, then get my art groove on. Walking into the space, with its pub-like (but cleaner) aesthetic, exposed brick walls, and complementing pieces of art,  I felt immediately at ease. The seating at the bar was plentiful  and when I arrived, around 5 pm, there was a decent buzz going, but at no point did I feel hemmed in. TVs are available but when I visited it was a ""tube-free zone"". The bartender mentioned that is by design; they might put the TVs on during lunch if there is a game, or during the weekends for catching up on sports while brunching. The glassware is quality, which is always huge in my book. The mix-and-match, yet chic look put me in mind of an Anthroplogie housewares section, or that friend who has a knack for putting things together with unstudied elegance.From a happy hour perspective, I was definitely blown away. In addition to Bar Lupo's signature spritzes, pretty much all of the wines, some beers, and cocktails were on special from 4 pm- 6 pm. I tried a Rose (excellent and well-balanced) as well as a Prosecco. Both were perfection. My water glass was refilled without my even having to ask. I also decided to try--why not--the signature meatball dish. I was very impressed by the quality, plating, and execution of the dish. Not only that, but when I asked for bread to be brought out, a server materialized seemingly immediately with a few slices of lightly toasted Italian bread. Now, that is service! I'm already plotting my next trip back to Bar Lupo, definitely for happy hour but also for lunch/dinner or brunch.",5.0,11,7,5

I'm not even sure what score is appropriate -- or what is appropriate to mention, although I will mention it all.We showed up at Bar Lupo thinking it was Japanese. The banner outside has a white background and red half circle on the foreground. It essentially is half of the Japanese flag. Nope, Italian pub. Nonetheless, we all like Italian so we entered.While there is outdoor seating we opted to sit inside. The inside is intimate, dark and befitting of a nicer pub. Remember, it is harder to see what shade of color your meat is, when in a dark setting (for better or worse, I prefer this atmosphere). Our waitress was nice, although it switched over to a different waiter at one point. Everyone enjoyed their meals, except for one of my coworkers. While she enjoyed the palenta, brussel sprouts and whatever else we had as an appetizer -- her chicken was under-cooked. My colleague didn't say a thing -- to anyone. The waiter noticed that she didn't finish the chicken, noticed it was under-cooked, came over to apologize, and literally did everything in his power to remedy the situation. Everything. This waiter was great, top notch. Probably deserves to be promoted to management. Regardless, my colleague still had food poisoning the next day (or sooner, I didn't get into the weeds on the ""when"" aspect of that). Now, it is hard to directly link the two, but the case is compelling. Would I go back? Yes, I had a great experience and found the service to be above-and-beyond. Would my colleague go back? Probably not since she had food poisoning the next day. Had her experience been better, I'd give Bar Lupo four or five stars.",3.0,2,0,2

Our waitress was awesome and the owner stopped by our table a couple times to check on us which was great.To start we shared the garlic knots, meatballs, and avocado toast. All were delicious, but those garlic knots with tomato sauce and basil were addicting! If I remember correctly, we even ended up putting in a second order to share.For my main meal I actually went with their spicy mussels with tomato, fennel, and crusty bread ($13.99). The mussels and it's juices were very flavorful! I kind of wish the bread it came with was softer for dipping though, because I actually ended up ordering more bread -- the mussel broth was so good!Their wine and cocktail list was great. Most of the wines on there I had never heard of before, but whatever red I ended up drinking was delish! The Cubs won that night and the restaurant even gave out complimentary glasses of champagne which we gladly accepted :)Overall, a really great establishment.

Our waitress was fantastic, she offered her honest opinion and provided great suggestions. She visited our table often and our food was served in a timely manner. Barrio management stopped by as well to make sure we were enjoying our dinner. Barrio does a really nice job with their cocktails. My friends and I have always really enjoyed our drinks even though we all have different tastes and preferences. On this visit I had the rhythm is a dancer cocktail, it was fruity but not overly sweet, and the liquor did not over power the taste of the drink. For an appetizer we had the burrata served with polenta bread. It was super tasty and I liked that it was a lighter tasting appetizer. I would definitely order the burrata, kale and corn empanadas, and the guacamole again. Next time I come, I'm going to try their sweet potato guacamole. My favorite app thus far has been the nachos, those are a must try! I really like when restaurants have unique menu options and Barrio definitely doesn't disappoint with interesting combinations of flavors. For dinner I had the barbakoa tacos, you can tell the corn tortilla shells are freshly made. I enjoyed the overall flavor of the tacos, and I was pretty full after eating three of them. My friend got the mushroom vegetarian tacos, they are a good option if you are a vegetarian but the meat tacos are definitely better. Next visit, I want to try the deconstructed chicken tacos! We ended the night with some tres leche. It is definitely more than enough for 1 and the perfect size for 2. I like their take on this dessert.

However, the tepid service and upcharging (small dish of fruit was 7) left me dinging them one star - it's likely a 3.5. Ironically, my experience suggests that the same flawed model applies to Siena Tavern, so it may be an operational trait.  We went to brunch, a relatively recent addition to the menu, and tried several promising items: the guacamole (OK but probably not worth it), churro French toast (delicious and well done with dragonfruit and grilled pineapple plus horchata whipped cream), lemon ricotta pancakes (OK but not memorable), chilaquiles with chicken (good flavor but lacked the salsa add on that I expected), and sopes eggs Benedict (good but lacked something, maybe spice or the chipotle hollandaise was too mild). I should add that everything was aesthetically pleasing - the display deserves credit.  The service was off and each one of us wondered if the explanation was the busy brunch schedule, the table location, or just our server. It wasn't clear but in any case, some of the unmet basics were frustrating (needing napkins, extra utensils, asking a follow up question or being clear about items on the menu).

The octopus only had one small piece and had 4 fingerling potatoes. This dish would have been better if it was all potatoes as the sauce as tasty.

We had: Churros French Toast: I was nearly 80% done with the plate when I realized, ""Wait this is supposed to be churros french toast. Nothing seems churrro-y about this. Did they get my order wrong?"" I was expecting more of a churro consistency, crispier with that cinnamon sugar coating. It had neither of those aspects and my expectations were way off! Later, Chef Katsuji explained they take the churros and make it into a bread pudding. Then they lightly fry the outside. Now that made 100% sense. Was it good, yes. The inside was very moist, topped with dragon fruit and whipped cream. Surprisingly, not too sweet. Chef also mentioned he serves a concha french toast the same way at his other restaurant in LA. Pretty cool. Barbacoa Hash: I'd have to say this was my least favorite dish. It wasn't terrible but when the majority of the hash is made up of sweet potatoes, one would hope the potatoes would be softer. The chunks of sweet potatoes were not thoroughly cooked and had a lot of bite to it. I think it was because maybe they expected them to finish cooking in the scorching hot cast iron skillet they were served in. Really did not enjoy eating these potatoes. The Barbacoa on the other hand was really good and the best thing about this dish. The meat was shredded a little thicker (similar to carnitas) and they give a huge slab. Topped with egg this completed the breakfast aspect.   Sopes Barbacoa Benedict: Best brunch dish among them all. What really stood out was The Chipotle Barbacoa meat. This version of meat was far better than what came in the hash. Super tasty, tender and very thinly shredded. A nice new approach to the average Benny. Service was a little slow considering we were only a table of two. Ambiance was very upbeat. The live DJ in the DJ booth playing a mix of old school house music will defiantly get your blood going in the morning! Awesome bathroom any girl squad would be sure to spend some time in snap'n pics under the shiny disco ball! Overall, pricy but, to be expected for River North. Is it Mexican food I'd be eager to rush back to regularly, not so much. Occasionally, for a fun girls night out, yes. I'll be back to give their dinner menu a try.Shout Out to Chef Katsuji! It was an absolute pleasure meeting you! Thanks for sending over your list of restaurant recommendations I hope to try some when I travel to Mexico! You're totally down to earth! Thanks for scoping us out and taking the time to explain the process behind your dishes! Stay awesome!",4.0,23,16,10

Usually I want to try a new place during this week, but I couldn't say no to my friends (& my soul). We were seated promptly once everyone arrived. There were 7 of us. They sat us at one of their booths. We l-o-v-e-d it. It had a large marble table, which was perfect for pictures, curtains at the side, and a chandelier that gave very adequate and nice lighting. The place was packed so I'm glad we were more off to the side so we could hear each other talk. It was many of my friends' first times doing CRW so I had to explain the menu for them. At first; some were just going to order from the main menu, but once they found out they get TWO dishes for $22, they were stoked. For my first course I ordered the churro French toast. That spoke to my soul. It was fluffy, sweet and the perfect portion. My friend loved how the pineapple was grilled. The whip actually tasted like horchata. Amazing. 5/5 For the second course I ordered the Barbacoa short rib hash. Soo savory. The egg was cooked perfectly, the rib was tender, and it was flavorful. At one point I told my friend that it needs rice (we're Asian) and she agreed, or at least some toast or potato to soak up the savory. Looking back at the menu I see there's caramelized sweet potato. Didn't even realize that was in there. Sweet potato is already sweet and caramelizing it adds to that sweetness. It would have been better with a more *starchy* plain carb. 4.5/5 What elevated our experience even more was the free shot of Rumchata they gave us! Thank you, Barrio!! Also, our waitress Yasmin/Jasmin was the best!Now for some feels from my friends:Açaí bowl 3.5/5 - none of them had one before so didn't really know what it should taste like. A bit sour and not that many toppings. Adobo fried rice 2.5/5 - said it was bitter (lemon perhaps?). She ate most of it but disliked it enough to mention it twice. Lemon Ricotta pancakes 4/5 - yummy but very sweet. There's 4 pancakes stacked and he ate half of that stack. There's only so much lemon you could take at one time. Mushroom and Kale omelette 3/5 - standard omelette. Could be made at home. TL;DR Definitely take a trip to Barrio for CRW and/or in general. Love the food here.",5.0,5,4,2
6UppKeQ8-hBnxhOMCMl_uw,Xs7VQkl9cFTWQqmq69UvuQ,IZ2O9lhzwZ9ai32-5_D02g,2/3/2018,"I get excited about Chicago Restaurant Week every year and try to hit a few spots to take advantage of the incredible deals offered around the city. I dined at Barrio in River North with a group of friends for dinner this past Friday night. I have been to Barrio for their opening and for drinks but never to dine. I have also checked out their Bodega around the corner which I love. So I was excited to finally eat at Barrio. I and another friend arrived about 10 minutes late but our other two friends were already seated. We joined them at the booth but I immediately felt crowded as we all had our winter coats. I waited patiently for our server to come to the table to see about checking our coats but it seemed to be taking quite awhile. I got another employee's attention and asked if we could check our coats. While waiting, our server showed up and asked if we wanted any drinks. All I wanted at that moment was to check the coats so I could sit comfortably. Haha! Maybe it's just me but I felt like the coats were crowding me and it being Friday night after what seemed like a long week, I just wanted to relax and be comfortable. Coats were checked, I ordered a cocktail, and we all placed our CRW menu orders. I posted the menu below. We tried almost the entire menu amongst the 4 of us. I enjoyed the grilled octopus though some thought it was a bit chewy. I liked the agave jalapeno and roasted tomato mayonesa very much though wish it was on the side instead of right on top of the octopus so I could really taste it on its own. Both the burrata and queso fundido were good.The Forest Mushroom Tacos are a popular menu item and many people have raved about them, meat eaters included. I did not have them but my friend seemed to love them. I really loved the Diver Scallops. The combination of flavors with the roasted fennel puree, chimichurri,  and habanero-uni butter was really terrific. Two of us ordered this dish and we both seemed to really enjoy it. The final person ordered the Tamarind Beef Shortrib and didn't love it. I tried it and thought it was quite good and having lived in the south I always welcome grits.. The final course was probably the least exciting/enjoyable. Most of us ordered the cocoa taco and one person ordered the churros (not me). I've had the churros at their bodega and really love them but it seems the churros served at the restaurant are just okay. The dipping sauces seemed to win favor over the actual churros. The cocoa taco was a clever idea but nothing special. The presentation was definitely all off. They served the small dessert taco on a large plate making it look awkward. I would have like a contrast of flavors - maybe adding some strawberries. And I really think it would've been much more of a wow if they used fried ice cream instead of chocolate ice cream. But this is only my opinion and I should mention that I am not a huge dessert person. Though I do love ice cream except for chocolate really. Go figure.The server did check in once or twice to see how we liked everything but other than that service was just okay. I was the only one at the table who ordered a cocktail and when I finished it the server didn't check to see if I wanted another one. At the end of our meal, one of the managers came by the table to see how we enjoyed everything. When the manager asked me directly, I had to be honest. I let her know overall I enjoyed the night but thought service could have been better. I mentioned the issue with the cocktail which I know in retrospect is minor but I had just worked a long week, recently met a guy that I am really into, and am in the process of interviewing for a great job so I wanted to celebrate. All of this is beside the point but I was thinking of ordering another drink. Surprisingly and very graciously, the manager offered to buy us all a round of cocktails. I wasn't expecting anything at all but this was definitely a welcome surprise to end the night and a lovely way to treat your guests. I appreciated her gesture and would return based on my overall experience and the quality of food. 1st BURRATA michigan honey, agave salsa verde, polenta breadQUESO FUNDIDOgarlic marinated piquillo peppers, escabeche,taqueria salsa, heirloom corn tortillasROASTED SWEET POTATO GUACAMOLE candied bacon, cranberries, pepitas, goat cheeseGRILLED OCTOPUS crispy papas, agave-jalapeño, roasted tomato mayonesa2nd FOREST MUSHROOM TACOS white truffle garlic crema, cotija cheese, gruyere francesCHICKEN AL PASTOR TACOS deconstructed achiote marinated chicken, pickled red onion, crispy kale, avocado salsa verde,charred pineapple, morita salsaDIVER SCALLOP roasted fennel puree, chimichurri, habanero-uni butterTAMARIND BEEF SHORT RIB anson mills grits, fermented red chiles3rd CHURROS cinnamon chocolate fudge, salted caramel, vanilla cremaCOCOA TACO milk chocolate ice cream, coconut crema, brownie crumble, guajillo caramel, coconut toffee",3.0,2,1,1

We were seated promptly for our reservation, but had to be moved to make room for a party of 13. Multiple managers came out to personally apologize for the inconvenience and comped is a round of drinks. Servers were constantly making rounds to refill water glasses and check in on our experience. The executive chef was even making rounds!At $33, the restaurant week menu is a great deal! Especially when the short rib alone is normally $30+. We ordered...Roasted Sweet Potato Guacamole: This was a solid guacamole. I'm always a fan of cranberries in guac - shout out to l'patron! However, I think we were expecting more sweet potato. It was more of a garnishment than a core part of the dish. Grilled Octopus: The crispy papas outshines the octopus here. They were so good! The octopus was a tad overcooked, but tasted great with the sauces. Diver Scallop: Generous portion of scallops with creamy fennel puree. Good, but not super duper memorable. Tamarind Beef Short Rib: I know, I know. Tamarind is in the name, but we weren't expecting it to be quite so sweet. It's much more sweet than savory. However, it was beautifully cooked and my friend still ate it all! Churros: This was amazing. Our only complaint was that there wasn't more churro. The sauces were on point!!Cocoa Taco: Great chocolate ice cream inside this taco. However, I'd recommend the churros over this. Hands down!Because the service was so thoughtful, we wouldn't hesitate to come back and give it another shot!",4.0,1,1,1

You'll definitely need to make a reservation in advance. I really liked that we shared different plates at the table to get the full experience of what they offer. I had a mimosa but it was a sweet and tangy orange juice with tomato juice in it. You only needed a splash in your champagne and it was delicious! This is a must go to brunch place if you are milling around Chicago wondering what to do and where to eat.,5.0,1,1,0

Perhaps I am just too huge of a fan of traditional flavors? Anyway, I was out voted 4 to 1 during Chicago Restaurant Week 2018.  Barrio had a variety of offerings on their CRW menu for Brunch, Lunch, and Dinner. We had a 2:30 PM reservation and was able to decide on either the Brunch or Lunch option. As always, diners are welcome to choose off the regular menu as well. Our party of 5 ordered off the brunch option. Food:Adobo Fried Rice: Fried rice mixed with crispy pork belly, and topped off with a perfectly fried sunny side up egg. We were very impressed with the flavor profile of the pork belly as well as the crunch to melt in your mouth factor up against the creaminess of the egg yolk and tang of the fried rice.  It was a beautiful marriage of meat to carb combo. We don't recommend trying each item on it's own. Mix the three and go on a flavor adventure.Avocado and Heirloom Cherry tomato on toast: You get this hefty slice of bread that has a balanced toasting ratio ( because no one likes burnt toast), decked out from bottom to top, mash avocado, watermelon radish, heirloom cherry tomatoes, poached egg, and topped off with a dash of togarashi. The visual presentation was most certainly instagram worthy and the taste was delicious. From 1st bite to last, you get a mouthful of this crunchy/chewy texture (toast), creamy(avocado & egg yolk), bit of sweet and sour ( watermelon radish), acidity(tomatoes), and hit of heat (togarashi). It is a dish that will touch your basic 5 senses.   Barbacoa Short Rib Hash: Hefty serving of tender melt in your mouth barbacoa short ribs, caramelized sweet potato,charred jalapeño, a poached egg, topped with morita hollandaise. Everything in this dish worked well, but I found that the caramelized sweet potato was overpowered by the slow burn heat of the dish. Dragon Fruit Acai Bowl:Blended acai, topped with dragon fruit, black raspberries, spiced granola, strawberries, and sliced bananas. I didn't care too much for this dish. I found the blended acai on the water side, rather than the consistency of a thick smoothie. Salsa: Freshly fried house made tortilla chips, with salsa verde , white habanero, and a third one I don't recall the name.  The house made chips were fantastic. I personally enjoyed the white habanero and salsa verde mixed together. The 3rd one wasn't memorable, which probably explains why I cannot recall what it was for the life of me.Tacos De La Boga: The restaurant's tortillas, made from heirloom blue corn , grown by Oaxacan farmers are phenomenal. They just create this perfect vessel to carry the spit roasted pork, cheesy scrambledfree range eggs, cilantro, onion,salsa morita, and filament potato directly into your mouth.Drinks:Cuban Tea Party, Smoke Show, Hot Mezz, and King Horchata: all delish!Dessert: Ice Cream Sundae: House made ice creams (fruity pebble, horchata pecan, chocolate graham cracker), topped with house made churros, a brownie crumble, chocolate covered peanuts, cinamion fudge, mixed berry reduction, and a waffle taco with whipped cream. An extremely over the top, decadent, must try dessert. It was perfect for 5 people to share and a sweet cap to the Barrio experience.",4.0,1,1,0

We actually went with a lot of her recommendations so this made all the difference.We got to start off with a small brunch shot that was delicious and then went to the bottomless mimosas. The blood orange mimosas were perfect and our server was so attentive in filling our glasses so you didn't feel like you were getting skimped. I love the unique spin that they offer on their food and the flavor combos work so well. My favorites included the pancakes and also the adobo fried rice. Those are a must when you go!

Now the eggplant...last minute add to the order - it was sweet and tangy, the texture of the soft eggplant against the crunchy almonds and then the smooth crema, it was a perfect mixture. Other people loved their deconstructed tacos. And I saw a salad. But I was pretty transfixed in getting tacos into my gullet. There were also drinks:- the Cuban tea party: dangerous with tequila and green tea. It went down a little too easy. I could drink those all day- the mula: a Cuban mule with mandarin, a little tang, the sweet orange...at one point or another during the evening, everyone ordered one. - frozen horchata.

For the entree, three of us ordered the short rib and the fourth ordered the deconstructed Al Pastor Tacos. I can't speak to the tacos, but the short rib fell apart and melted in your mouth.

I definitely recommend making a reservation. We were in no rush, so we waited approximately 45 minutes for a table. In the meantime, we tried a few of their drinks. The bee's knees and dark and stormy mule were delicious. Really good cocktails overall.Roasted bone marrow with red onion jam and parsley: The concept is similar to the bone marrow at Longman and Eagle. The difference is that the bone marrow portion is huge.16 oz prime ribeye: A beautifully fatty, and ginormous cut of meat that was perfectly cooked and seasoned for an insanely reasonable price. It came with an herb-y salt on the side that you could add to the dish that was also really flavorfulSteamed Mussels with lemon vermouth broth and thyme: The mussels were well cleaned, and cooked perfectly. The sauce was the star of the dish. I was full by the time I was halfway done, but couldn't help but keep dipping the accompanying bread in that heavenly sauce to eat. Oddly enough, when we said we wanted to take the remainder to go- the waiter told us that he could not package it for us since it was a seafood dish. We ended up finishing the mussels but the frugal side of me wished that I could have kept that sauce.I was a lot more impressed by Gilt bar than I thought I would be.

I ordered the truffle pasta and my husband ordered the short rib stroganoff. Both dishes were excellent. His short rib was cooked very well and I caught myself sneaking a few bite of it! My truffle pasta was pretty good, I love anything truffle. I appreciated the portion sizes they served as any more and it would've been too much. The dish was extremely rich- all the butter and oil. I wish it would've had another component like a pancetta or prosciutto. To be honest, I wouldn't get this dish again (I'm glad I tried it). I went between my truffle pasta dish and the ribeye steak. However the steak was 16oz that night and it seemed a little too big for my appetite that night. The ambience was really nice! It was very dark in there (troubling to read the menu).

I had the lovely opportunity to visit this restaurant/bar on Valentine's Day. The restaurant ambiance is a magnificent blend of modern urban paired with old world Victorian décor. When both design elements are added to a dimly lit environment, it makes for an ideal prelude to a romantic evening.The menu isn't extensive but the offerings are solid. For appetizers, we had the bone marrow on toast with red onion jam. The enormous portion was enough to satisfy 3 people. I never had bone marrow until then and post meal, I liked it a lot. I'm not a professional food critic but my unrefined description of bone marrow is similar to a meaty butter spread. The red onion jam adds a tartness and texture to this dish which is phenomenal. I've never had anything like it before and I'm glad I got a chance to try it.The real star of the show was their smoked whitefish Caesar salad. It has the flavor you would expect from a Caesar salad with a few unexpected surprises. Instead of croutons, there is a crunch from the potato chips. Yes, you heard that right, I said potato chips. This crisp flavor profile is paired with an unusual protein (the smoked whitefish). The smoky flavor from the whitefish gives off a distinct taste making your traditional Caesar salad better on so many levels. I know it's just a salad, but it's a salad worth ordering.  The Ribeye, as expected, was deliciously juicy, well-seasoned, and meaty. The garlic mashed potatoes were okay but it wasn't a standout. Overall, our main dish and side was enjoyable.  It's best to make reservations so we made them in advance to guarantee a table. I've read in prior reviews that on some nights, this can be a challenge. We didn't want to take that risk. From start to finish, husband and I savored each sip and bite.

Wasn't super amazing so not sure why this place has a ton of stellar reviews, but it probably just means I need to come back and try the bone marrow.The table wine is cheap at only $5 and we spent about 2-3 hours here, so definitely a good spot for catching up over dinner.",4.0,2,0,0

Lot of flavor, very fresh, and the pasta dishes come together nicely. The smashed potatoes with chicken jus is the best mashed potatoes I've ever had, truly addicting. They have other entrees for seafood and other meat, very nice menu here and you should love it!Plan ahead for this one, it's not a easy table to get.

3AT0A8Y-N14xBQvyRCaHAg,sDYjKyI_67eUhFAqVneYjA,_fCHKg5d7xAIIPr2P5RiSQ,1/23/2018,"I followed my heart and it lead me to Gilt bar. A friend of mine decided to go out and celebrate my engagement. I absolutely fell in love with the portion of the restaurant called the library. I told my fiancé I was going to dinner with a friend but he didn't ask me what restaurant I was going to until I was parking my car to walk into Gilt. He tells me that his uncle, Charlie, was responsible for the remodeling and part construction of Gilt and to say hello to the owner (R) on his behalf and since I loved the design of Gilt to inquire about the other restaurants owned by this family. Isn't it crazy how small the world is? I had no idea. Anyways, my friend had gotten to Gilt before me and she had put our names down on the wait list and one of the hostesses told her that it would be anywhere from a half an hot wait to an hour and fifteen but just to keep an eye out on her phone when she gets the text confirmation that her table is ready. Anyways, when I walked in, I guess the hostess didn't realize that I was with my friend Alex and so I said to her is the owner here and she said no unfortunately R isn't here tonight and then she said I'll see if I can get a table for you earlier and again took our names down. We decided to get a drink (me Non-alcoholic and my friend a gin and honey) while we waited for our glorious text. Once we figured out the library was downstairs, we asked the hostess, Keira, if we could be seated in the library and she said, ""oh it's a four hour wait for the library, not tonight ladies"".... not gonna lie, I was sad to hear it. We finally got our text and approached Keira and even before we told her we got a text, she says, ""oh I'm not ready for you"" and my friend pulled out her phone and said, ""that's okay, someone else is because we got a text"" - Keira or Kyra with the headband looked dumbfounded how we got seated so quickly after being on the wait list for about 25 minutes. To make matters worse for Keira, IMAGINE OUR SHOCK when a super nice hostess says to my friend and me, ""follow me downstairs ladies"" and my friend and I look at each other and were like wait, ""downstairs?"" And she says, ""the library"". I wanted to bust out my happy dance. This super nice server had no idea that we had inquired about seating in the library!! What a fiasco with the hostesses. The usually tell you a much longer wait time than how long you'll actually wait. So don't be scared away by the wait. Despite all the issues with getting a seat, my friend and I were besides ourselves from joy. After we were seated, we ordered the Burrata. It was my first time having Burrata so I didn't know what to expect. The waiter told us its a combo mozzarella and cream cheese. If you ask me, it could have used some salt because it tasted a bit bland. However, paired with the fire roasted tomatoes- Lord have MERCY!! It was absolutely incredible! I could have eaten the tomatoes all night long. First of all, they had that freshly picked tomato smell that I rarely come across in the US. Secondly, they were sweet and marinated so they really complimented the Burrata along with the bread so well. Gilt won me over the moment I saw the very well toasted bread- thank you Gilt!! As for our main dish, I ordered the roasted salmon and my friend had the ricotta gnocchi and we had a side of the mashed potatoes. The salmon itself was melt in your mouth goodness, it was juicy yet really well cooked. It was slightly crispy on the outside which I didn't complain about because I love that. I really didn't like the capers served with the fish because it was too sour and salty for my liking!! Thank goodness for the mashed potatoes because they really complimented the fish. The mashed potatoes had chicken jus, roasted garlic and chives. The chicken jus was usual to see but really tasty. I'm not a mashed potato type of girl but these mashed potatoes were divine. Let's talk about the gnocchi. Wow. The waiter told us it was house made and let me just tell you, homie was not lying!! If you've ever made any type of bread or pasta at home, then you know how the dough of that feels on your hand... soft on texture, light on your skin and plump in size. Well, the gnocchi tasted like that and some. The ricotta cheese inside was sort of fluffy but not really but smooth. Paired with the butternut squash, this was fine dining at its best! It was soooo smooth to eat- I've never tasted anything like it! I highly recommend it!Overall, service was okay. The food took a while to come out and the waiter wasn't as attentive as I would have liked him to be but I understand, happens on Friday's! The place is super clean but also really dimly lit so that you could barely read the menu without turning on your iPhone flash.  This place has a certain ambiance that makes you feel like you stepped into the mobster scene back in the 1920's. I absolutely love the atmosphere. Good date night place as the warm environment paves the way for romance!",4.0,0,0,0

The broth is delicious and we used every last crumb of that sourdough bread to soak it up. The orecchiette was really good too, loved it with the chorizo. The cauliflower gratin was just ok.

There were waitresses everywhere and nobody came to assist us or ask did we need anything. Growing angry I went back to the hostess and asked what's up for service for this table? They apologized and said they'd get us served. We got a male server who was very apologetic that we hadn't been greeted and he said he saw us being seated so he knows we've been waiting. Ok cool thanks for the acknowledgement and not sweeping it under the rug!On to the food.... we ordered the ribeye med, and also the pasta dish w/spicy pork no way on hell I can spell it Orecchiato or some crap lol. Also ordered drinks, I see they use gin in everything. I got the French 75. The drinks were sourly good. My steak was so damn good I want to go back TODAY!!!!!!

This steak was good the table next to me waited for me to dig in to see my reaction to the taste and dammit it was heaven on earth!!!!

Growing up and living in Chicago we are accustomed to the Lou Malnati's of the world. Bar Cargo's pizza is out of this world. The crust is crispy throughout and unbelievably different than anything in the area. The sausage was the best sausage I have had on a pizza outside of a New York slice. Bar Cargo will be a favorite of ours in 2018 for both drinks and pizza...especially the pizza. One recommendation - pick up the pace of the music.",5.0,4,0,0

However, I was in this past weekend and a couple things bugged me.  First, the waiter begrudgingly refused to write separate checks for our table.  Yes, there were seven of us, but it simply doesn't matter.  It's 2018 and the point-of-sale software is so easy to bust up individual checks nowadays that I found his approach extremely lazy.  He only agreed to split the check evenly which can make for awkwardness when customers have varying quantities of food and drink.  Just politely do what your customers ask and it makes it way easier.  They'll tip you more because of it, too (I still tipped over 20%).Second, as the night was coming to a close, the lights were made brighter throughout the restaurant, the music was turned down, and the staff stacked up chairs on virtually every other table as a definitive sign that they wanted to shut down.  For the record, we were not the last party in the place and it was just after 11PM.  This practice is rude and inconsiderate, and should be abandoned immediately.  Your night is not done until your customers are gone, so stop sending signals that you want them to leave.  With the cost of dining at Sunda as significant as it is, we have at least earned your hospitality till we walk out the door.  If you want to close earlier, don't take reservations as late as you offer now. Perhaps it was a little bit of an off night?  Maybe the waiter had a bad day and the staff needed to get home quickly?  I'm not sure.Again, my five-star review stands despite the aforementioned challenges.  I'll be back for sure and would still recommend Sunda for its outstanding food.  Also, service at every prior visit has been nothing short of exemplary.",5.0,2,1,1

What an amazing time!Arrived a little bit early for our 8pm Friday reservations so we had a seat at the bar. Sunda has a long list of interesting and fun cocktails as well as long list of wines/sake/beer.  Since I love lychee, I opted for their Lychee Luxury Drop--vodka, st germain, lychee syrup and a hint of wasabi.  Fruity and tropical but with a bit of warmth for the cold Chicago night. They texted that our table was ready (10 min early!).  We walked past the long counter/sushi station and several tables. The decor is sleek, Asian inspired and settings are good for dates as well as groups. The menu is full of Asian flavors and covers land and sea. Asian dining is family style so passing plates and sharing is encouraged. I think we over-ordered--we were celebrating my BFF's birthday after all, so no guilt, right?  Chef Jess came out to talk to us and brought us two specials to enjoy. The starter--a salmon and lobster ""nigiri"" with jalapeno, wasabi cream, tobiko and cucumber--a perfect starter, so fresh and delicious.  The other special was 2 glasses of chilled sake which paired perfectly with our ordered dinner.  Chef Jess was very gracious and friendly and everything we ordered was a winner.  The flavors were sigh-inducing, and the presentations were beautiful. Service was stellar from host/hostess to bussers. We truly enjoyed our meal and experience.

My friend and I started off the meal with a Paloma ($12) and Root Down ($13). The Paloma was nice and refreshing and root down was fruity and sweet. Both drinks were on the stronger side. Then we decided to split the ceviche trio ($24). The tropical tuna cocktail was my favorite due to the sweetness element from the pineapple. The ceviche also came with chips and a red and green salsa, which were slightly spicy but not too overpowering. For our main entrees we opted for the duck breast with morita-mango sauce ($25) and the Friday special: Suadero Ahumado ($25) (20 hour smoked beef brisket in black mole and mashed potatoes). I had the beef brisket which was phenomenal; the meat was tender and flavorful and came in a large portion size. My friend really enjoyed her duck entree as well.

The goat milk caramel was way creamier than normal caramel and complemented the ice cream well. This place is super popular and may be difficult to get reservations for; the wait is usually over 2 hours for large groups.

I mean it was tasty, because cheese is ALWAYS tasty, but not as flavorful as I was expecting. I ordered the Enchiladas (Chef's Choice), which at the time was duck carnitas. It was a large order that definitely filled me up. The whole dish was on the dry side.

Being Mexican, I consider myself a very tough grader, and I must say Frontera Grill has my Mexican stamp of approval. First of all, I highly recommend having a reservation. This place gets packed on any given night. I was fortunate enough to have a reservation and Was able to get seated way before my reservation. They do have a $15 valet and a coat check in upon arrival. Everyone was very welcoming a profesional. It really felt like I was entering someone's home. We started off with their Tortilla Soup and their Queso Fundido. The Queso fundido came with poblano peppers and a decent amount of chorizo. It tastes very good with their side of salsas and tortillas. The Tortilla soup was presented beautifully. They bring out the bowl with just their tortilla strips and they'll pour the broth over the strips. The tortilla soup came with chicken, avocado and jack cheese. It was also very tasty. The highlight of the night was their Oaxacan Carne Asada. A perfectly cooked and juicy medium rare, red chile marinated ribeye. It came with a side of guacamole, black beans and sweet plantains. It was all delicious and I definitely took advantage of their fresh tortillas and basically made myself tacos using the beans and guac and salsas. I can't wait to come back. I really do want to try everything they have to offer and will eventually accomplish that. Everyone was very professional, and delivered exceptional service through out the night.",5.0,2,2,0

Without a reservation, according to the host, the wait could be 45 mins to 1.5 hrs. However, there is a bar area where you can wait. We had a reservation for 10pm and the place was definitely packed when we walked in. It's a small-ish restaurant with lots of bold colors, artwork, and an open kitchen. They also have a complimentary coat check.Our server was friendly, knowledgeable, but not particularly attentive.They have beer, wine, cocktail, and margarita offerings, as well as some virgin drinks. Their house made limeade is outstanding. I opted for the margarita shaken table side and poured in a martini glass - and made with their limeade. So delicious and seriously dangerous! The champagne margarita was also good.The menu had a good number of options. It's was difficult to settle on what to get. Here's what we opted for:- oysters and ceviche- chef's choice guacamole - tamales- duck breast- striped bass (special)- carne asada brava- Mexican chocolate ice creamThe oysters had a unique twist with an onion and hot pepper vinegar minongette, smoky chipotle hot sauce, and limes. The classic ceviche was alright. Not a lot of flavor, but everything was very fresh. The tropical ceviche was fabulous with lots of fresh and citrus flavors.The fiesta guacamole (chef's choice version) was unique and flavorful - though, very packed with toppings. Crunchy beets, pumpkins seeds, oranges, sprinkles, etc. It's a great twist on a classic.The tamales were thicker than expected, but excellently made.The entrees were all very solid choices. Everything was tender and flavorful. The carne asada was my favorite. And the mashed potatoes that accompanied the fish were also a favorite.We were stuffed, but couldn't pass on dessert. We were all used to Mexican chocolate being dark and spicy, but this Mexican chocolate was actually a very light chocolate with cinnamon. Still tasty, but not what we were expecting. The chocolate sauce that was served with the ice cream was incredibly delicious.All in all, a fabulous meal. Would've been 5 stars if not for the sporadic service.",4.0,5,5,2

I've been to other restaurants by Rick Bayless and they're all amazing! I wish Frontera would come to New York I miss their food so much! Their brunch and dinner are amazing and you cannot go wrong with either. Before coming here I would recommend getting a reservation. I've never came here without a reservation but every time I came in or passed by the restaurant it's always busy! The only thing I wasn't fond of during brunch was that it wasn't unlimited drinks... But that's probably because I'm so use to doing unlimited brunch. Although, Frontera does not have unlimited drinks they do have amazing drinks and even better food! I ordered their Huevos Motuleños which comes with two fried eggs on a crispy tostada with roasted tomatoes, country ham, peas, sweet fried plantains, queso fresco, and black beans. I forgot what my boyfriend ordered but it was an egg dish as well. I loved both of what we ordered! I'm still thinking about that brunch. The margaritas they served were strong but really good. I've come here for dinner as well and I really recommend coming here for both dinner and brunch because it won't disappoint. I always love ceviche so, we ordered the ceviche trio. I love when places offer trios because it's a nice way to sample everything and I ended up loving all the flavors. We also tried their carne asada. Their wood grilled meats are a must! Honestly, probably everything on the menu is delicious. I don't think you can go wrong with anything. I love Frontera and it's probably one of the best Mexican restaurants I've ever been to.

I understand that this isn't the best time for waiters, so I am willing to give the waiter the benefit of the doubt for most things.That said, the waiter for my table could not have been ruder. Our plates for entrees were dropped unceremoniously while we were halfway through the appetizer. The real straw though was the waiter came back twice to tell us we were eating the mole and tortilla wrong. We were already 5 minutes into eating our meal when he came by to say that we didn't appreciate how the dish should really be eaten. Fine - but you could have told us that at the beginning! The second time he came by, it was even ruder about how we didn't understand how to eat the meal. I have literally been treated better at Chipotle.

Think this place is better at dinner. Service idk why but frontera grill needs better service  One great tip is that u could order desserts off the dinner menu. N plz make it so u can order a bunch of chonchas Best things:mini hotcakes/ pastry basket/ gorditas/ carne asada/ mole/Fall extravaganzaCHUPACABRA 11$: 2/5 (mexican bloody marry) good interpretation, but i love bloody marries n didnt really care for it, it was to watered down. Add some horseradish would be the best drink ever huitlacoche goat cheese tamal 8.50$: 2/5 good not great. Think rick makes the best tomales but The reason why i didnt really like this is because therere wasnt enough huitlacoche flavor n goatcheese.  Loved the squash blossom sauce it was so rich n goes perfectly with cheese. N the pee shoots added freshness OUR FAMOUS TORTILLA SOUP $8: 3/5 good not great the broth was good but was lacking depth. It needed more cheese  n there was like 2 pieces of chicken MINI HOTCAKES $5: 4/5 loved it but pancakes were cold.The pancakes were moist n flavorful not to sweet.  I loved the whipped goatcheese added an amaizing savory creamy component just put more after one bite ur done. Loved the walnuts for crunch just wish they were candied Spicy bacon $5: 0/5 didnt like it. It was old and cold couldnt taste any heat just tasted a little burnt to be honestChips/ salsa $3: 4/5 really good my favorite salsas are the tomatillo, n the habenro salsa the red one i didnt care for it was to watered downHOMEMADE MEXICAN PASTRY BASKET 8$ : 4/5 amaizin just they weren't warm which is unfortunate. the concha was amaizing it was so fluffy and buttery my only issue is the top was dry. Huachibola: this was amaizin the pastry was supper fluffy n the filling tasted amaizin adding a great savory note. Gordita de Piloncillo: i loved the spices but it was really dry like hard as a rockGORDITAS DE CHICHARRÓN $14: 4/5 amaizin the gorditas were really crunchy and flavorful i hate gorditas that arent crunchy the scrambled eggs were so soft the carnitas were good but there was jus like one tiny piece of meat wish there was more meat added n if chicaron was added as a crumble on top. The salsa was good just the gordita needed more so having extra on the side would be good. The salad was really good but it wasnt really an arugula salad because there was only one piece of arugula was more of a green salad loved it though cause the freshness cut through the richness Mushroom mixiote $15: 0/5 didnt like this. The dish needed salt really badly. The mushrooms were all overcooked n really rubbery n didnt care for the sauce wasnt that flavorful. I didnt like the dumplings they were really dryOAXACAN-STYLE CARNE ASADA $34.50$: 5/5 amaizin this is one of my favorite steaks because the steak is high quality it's extremely tender n its really flavorful im not a steak purist so i like my steak to have lots of flavor. The guac is really acidic and cuts through the richness of the dish. The plantains add great sweetness and their not burnt loved the addition of eggs for added richness just wish there were beans to make it complete this comes with tortillasMOLE POBLANO ENCHILADAS 4/5: $15 rick bayless makes the best mole so i would recommend always getting all the different kind of moles their so flavorful n their not sweet. The sauce was supper complex the filling was good just put more n loved the addition of black beansDuo de flans $8:25: 3/5amaizin theres two flans a traditional one and a unique one. The traditional one was fine just wish rick would focus more on the unique one because it tastes better and add more components to compliment the flavors better. The cheese flan had a wonderful cheese flavor that added a savory component to cut through the sweetness the pinapple salsa was okay didnt really add anything. The flan at xoco has the bacon popcorn if that was added to this dish would really make it taste better Sopa de frutas $9 : 2/5 this is really unique just its really soupy. The the soup needs to be thicker or needs substance its very soupy this dish needs a crunch factor really badly. the actual flavor of the soup was really had a wonderful corn flavor. Then theirs pieces of corn that adds a little texture wish the corn was used to make sweet hush puppies that would have been cool or like a corn cake i liked the rasberry icecream which added tartness to cut through the sweetnessFall extravaganza $9: 5/5 best dessert from brunch. The almond icecream was amaizin adding a nutty savory flavor to counteract the sweetness then theres really good vanilla icecream that gives a sundae vibe the sesame cake was amaizin adding a great savory flavor the concord grapes added acidity to counteract the sweetness then the merangue added crunchy sweetness",2.0,16,12,5

But for Frontera Grill, there are no equivalents and no alternatives. Rick Bayless is a master of his craft and a really great guy to boot. Frontera is the place I go whenever I can go. Great example: I moved from Chicago to NYC and on my first visit back to Chicago I made a reservation just to be there. I went twice -- once I found a friend to go with me and the other time I ate alone at 11 pm just because.The menu often changes, but there are some classics and staples that never do -- and that's a good thing.Queso fundido: My choice for a last meal. It's basically an iron skillet filled with melted cheese and chorizo. It's full of calories and despite eating healthy, I'll always indulge in this. It comes with hot, freshly-pressed tortillas and the signature Frontera salsas -- spicy red and fresh green verde. My tip that comes from experience and from the waiter: Eat it as soon as it comes out otherwise the cheese will harden.Carne asada Oaxaqueno: There are two kinds on the menu -- the other is called Brava -- but this one is my favorite because it's spicier. It's phenomenal.There are so many other dishes, but those two stand out every time. The cocktails here are stunning and fresh.

The food is ok to great but lacked consistency. The service was mediocre.We arrived an hour early, had a snack next door and arrived on time. We were seated in a spacious booth seat. We ordered the ceviche trio ($ 24), carne asada brava ($ 29) and enchiladas de cochinita pibil ($19). The ceviche trio was the best part of the meal. The tropical ceviche was mango tuna with red onions. This was refreshingly sweet and delicious. I also liked the Frontera ceviche with Hawaiian albacore, lime and tomatoes. The enchiladas were ok. Unfortunately the ""slow-cooked suckling pig cochinita pibil"" was dry and lacked many of the flavors of cochinita pibil such as cinnamon, cumin and orange flavors. It just tasted like a slightly dry roasted pork. The carne asada brava was flank steak, which was a perfect medium rare with grilled knob onions. The green onion part was wrapped into a knot. The flavors were ok but a little bland. This is something that could be made at home. The best part of this dish was the sweet corn tamales. They tasted of sweet fluffy corn cakes. Unfortunately, the service was not great. One of servers tossed my plate in front of me like a frisbee instead of handing it to me or placing it down in front of me.

If you're a sports fan, specifically a Golden State Warriors fan, this restaurant/bar is a must. Came here for Game 4 of the 2017 NBA finals (Friday, 6/9/17). We showed up about an hour and a half early and luckily secured the LAST table available. This place filled up super early and super quick. It's known to be a Golden State Warriors bar, and has been that way long before they started winning championships. Our server told us that when the owner opened it up years ago, he picked two of the worst teams in sports to follow. GSW was the NBA team that was chosen. I do not remember what the football team is for sure, though I believe it is the Patriots. Everyone here is cheering for the Warriors, so other fans: Be wary. Before the game, TVs were playing miscellaneous sports channels. Theory has countless TVs. You're bound to have a good view of at least a couple no matter where you sit. Once game-time hit, every TV was plugged into the game, and to my delight, they played game audio whenever it was on! During commercials, they would switch the audio to music. The music was on point. They had a good commercial break playlist. I liked their system. Makes it even easier to know when the games back on after commercials in case you get distracted.Top notch basketball sports bar atmosphere aside, Theory served me one of the best pulled pork sandwiches I have ever had. Seriously, it might be my favorite of all time. I scarfed it down in about a minute. It was big and substantial, too! Lots of meat. Great flavor. I'm craving another one as I write this. The house smoked pork shoulder with bbq sauce was to die for. The drinks were also good. I had myself quite a few beers while enjoying the game.Theory was easily one of my favorite restaurants/bars that I went to all trip. It has the BEST pulled pork sandwich around, for sure.

Although we did not request for a table by the window, we were seated right by the window. This was a pleasant and unexpected surprise, given how busy they were. We were also seated right away, which is always a plus! The view overlooking the water was beautiful! The windows could have been just a bit cleaner but the view made up for it.  We started off with the smoked wings and the masa crusted calamari. Food came out in about 10 minutes after we ordered. The smoked wings ($14) came with carrots and celery and a BBQ ranch. The BBQ ranch was so delicious! I ended up using the sauce for the calamari and the fries too. The wings were very smokey and flavorful but on the dryer side. I loved the carrots with the BBQ ranch so it made me sad when I couldn't eat all of them because the majority of the carrots were dirty (They needed an extra shave)- I could still see the dirt on them. Our server brought us hot towels just in time to wipe our sticky fingers off. This was a nice touch. The calamari ($14) had a very light and crunchy batter and was well seasoned, I could eat them without the chipotle lime dipping sauce. The portion was also generous. It was about 85% calamari and 15% fried red bell peppers, jalapeños, and onions. All the sauces were served in small mason jars which I thought was so cute. For the mains, my boyfriend got herb marinated skirt steak ($32) with the red wine demi glace and I got the mussels and merguez. Both mains came with fries but his fries were tossed in garlic and mine were just plain fries. I loved the flavor on his fries and regret not asking the server if I could get mine with the garlic as well. What was a bit odd to me was the variety of ""fried"" the fries were. Some of them looked barely fried, some of them looked too fried, and some of them in the perfectly fried. I did not taste any of the herb marinade on the skirt steak but maybe that was because of the demi-glace. However, the steak was tender and perfectly cooked. It was pre-sliced which was convenient. The mussels and merguez ($20) was delicious! Right off the bat, I noticed the generous portion, I think it was around 2lbs. I have to admit, I didn't know what merguez was so when I saw some ground beef in the broth with the mussels I was surprised but it worked well. It was a nice to have a different texture from time to time after eating multiple mussels. The broth itself was a bit spicy but very flavorful, the harissa was a unique touch. Mussels is a dish I frequently get and it is nice to see restaurants that step away from the generic white wine and garlic combo. Although I could dip my fries into the broth, I wish it came with some bread instead. I wanted some of that soaking action and fries just don't have the same soaking ability. As a side, we got the truffled mac and cheese ($8) (I know, we eat a lot) . Our server told us that the sides were meant to share but it was definitely on the smaller side. Definitely only two people max per side. The truffle flavor was very apparent but it did not overpower the cheese. There was little ""gooey"" factor but the penne was perfectly cooked . The breadcrumbs on top were crunchy which added a nice texture. Overall, a delicious side but could be a bit bigger for the price. Although we were too stuffed for dessert, I had to take a look at the options. They have many options for dessert, including house-made ice cream. I think next time I will save some room for the blueberry buckle or white chocolate bread pudding. Our server was attentive and not overbearing. He switched out my plate full of empty shells twice and always made sure our water glass was full. All and all, we had a really great time. The food and service was both above average but the view was definitely what made the restaurant stand out. We will definitely be back!",5.0,0,2,0

My husband is vegan, which presents difficulties when eating out. Some restaurants really make efforts to accommodate and this was one of them. For instance, they serve a small, complimentary dish before your food comes out. It was a broccoli soup, but they made a special cucumber and Avocado bite for my husband. However, the main menu is extremely limited for vegans. He had a salad and broccoli Rabe. I had the Bonito flake bread, which was obviously amazing for any bread lover. I also got the Tuna tartare. Had I known the tartare comes with a giant sesame crisp, I probably wouldn't have ordered the bread, though. The tartare is slightly spicy as it's served with a few slices of hot peppers, but it could certainly be spicier. My main dish was the cacio E pepe, which is served with caviar. I have never had caviar and I expected something more pungent and/or flavorful. The dish was good, but didn't knock my socks off.I also ordered the chocolate creme brulee with passion fruit gel. It tasted amazing but as I started eating it, the waitress brought out complimentary deserts. Again, I wouldn't have ordered the dessert had I known a free dessert was offered. The dishes came out very quickly. Almost as though they were pre-prepared, which was a bit of a turnoff. I like going out to eat and taking my time. At 55 minutes from start to finish, this was the fastest we've eaten a dinner.The restaurant is good and worth trying if you're staying at the dana hotel or are already in the neighborhood.

Little did we know, Portsmith is actually in the Dana Hotel, which also has a rooftop bar called Apogee (which we had tried before and loved). I don't usually like dining in hotels, but for lunch the space has tons of light and pretty decor. Service was really good too - no lag between courses and our water glasses were never empty. I started with the caesar salad with squid, tried the mussels for my main, and ended with the madagascar dessert. The deal was my friend would try the other dessert (called Greece) and we'd have a bite of each others. Which I'm so glad we did because the Greece dessert was phenomenal! By far both our favorite part of the meal. We were both let down by the mussels - although it was a hearty dish and the broth was quite delicious - something was off with the mussels themselves.

The more I look at other photos and reviews, the more I think that the kitchen must have been having a bad night. Many of the dishes in photos just look more neatly composed and more finessed than what we got. Nonetheless, our experience is enough to keep us from going back.We started off we a bunch of stuff from the raw bar selection. My wife is preggo and can't eat much of it, but I really wanted king crab. The waitress asked the chef if I could get it a la carte, but he said there was only enough for seafood tower portions. Still, we got the oysters (mostly good), the tiger prawns (overcooked and tough), and the hamachi crudo, which was completely underseasoned. We had to pour the mignonette from the oysters over the crudo to make it palatable. In fact, pretty much everything we ate was underseasoned--just on the verge of maybe being good but too bland to be interesting.This was true of the cacio e pepe (which was also way too heavily sauced and overcooked) and the octopus (although I really liked the texture). The bread was stellar, as others have said, and the scallop/pork belly app was the best plate of the night, although the pork belly was straight-up burnt.We finished with the 22 oz. ribeye, which was maybe a mistake at a seafood-focused restaurant, and it was pretty bad. We asked for medium rare, and it came out blue. It was a cold, seared piece of meat. We sent it back, and the chef threw it back on the fire for a bit. What emerged was the same steak, now tough, although slightly more cooked through. It was absolutely bland. I mean, I don't think there was single grain of salt--or any other kind of seasoning--on the thing. Worst steak I've ever had in a restaurant. Kindly, they took it off the bill, which eased that blow.The atmosphere and service are good enough, although the place was pretty quiet for a Saturday night. The staff started cleaning up the back half of the rather small restaurant when we were half-way through our meal, which I thought kind of killed the atmosphere. Nothing like eating a $200 meal while someone mops the floor 10 feet away.All in all, it wasn't great. We opted out of dessert, fearing more disappointment, and headed to a donut place instead. Can't win them all.",3.0,3,2,2

The foods really good just fix some issues. My biggiest disappointment was that the desserts werent as good as steadfast for charging that much for a dessert it better be the best dessert ever n have complexity it better not jus be a sweet dessert best things: look down at 5/5 ratingLaminated brioche 10$ -5/5(gourmet salmon n bagel) best smoked salmon dish i ever had. The brioche was the perfect texture it was so fluffy just wish it was warm n more flakier. The salmon was amaizin wasnt to smokey or salty was really delicate. The caviar made it look pretty jus didnt really add a salty component cause theres barely maybe use something else. The pickled onions added great acidity to cut through the richness jus add a little heat to it. My only complaint would be to add something a little sweet to make it more complexBonito flake sour dough $2 -5/5for only 2 bucks youll get amaizin bread and butter. The butter has an amaizing seafood flavor n the black garlic butter adds so much flavor. My only complaint is the bread wasnt toasted so it was a little hard in a bad way they gave us soup as an amuse bouche so u can dip the bread in the soupFried oyster $4- 5/5 i never liked fried oysters but this was amaizin the oyster was really fresh n the oyster was fried perfectly without being overcooked or greasy. The aioli was so rich just put more. The seaweed salad underneath added sweetness and brineyness that gave the dish complexity. My only complaint is add some heat oysters need spiceFancy oyster $5 -2/5 i didnt like this. I love the taste of oysters n felt the foie over powered it n couldnt taste the other ingredients in the dishFoie gras and donut 19$ -2/5 didnt like this. The foie was overcooked. N the donut was really hard. The strawberries weren't that sweet this reminded me of waffles with that strawberry sauce. If they cooked the foie gras properly it would taste better. If the donut was softer n maybe filled wit foie i think it would have been a better dish like a jelly/ foie donut n if they used figs would have been better Crispy octopus $14- 1/5 didnt like this. The octopus was cooked perfectly supper tender n crispy but it was bland needed salt. The yellow sauce was way to acidic. The chili was was really good though just put more of it. If they added a really rich component it would help make this dish betterOxtails with Russian dressing $14-5/5 amaizn if u love indian food n deep fried food youll love this. The oxtail was supper crispy and flavorful and tender The sauce underneath was so flavorful it had so much flavor. The mayo added richness just put more my only complaint is add some heat and something acidic but i would order this again rumaki 12$ amaizng.5/5 The scallops were cooked perfectly the carrot puree adds sweetness the ginger confit adds spicyness and acidity the bacon is amaizin its so thick and crispy adds a great salty flavor the sauce is so complex really enhances the dishAhi tuna and seared foie gras 39$ -5/5 best dish of the nite. The tuna was cooked very well and flavorful just wish it had a better sea and had more seasoning. The sauce was so rich and decadent just wish it was thicker the foie gras added decadence just wish it was medium rare n was a bigger portion. The broccoli rab was a good touch for bitterness just add more to cut through the richnessTurbot $38 3/5 good not great. The sauce was amaizin perfect combination of acidity and richness. However, there wasnt enough after one bite ur finished with the sauce. There needs to be more of a truffle flavor u dont really taste it. The fish was cooked perfectly but wish it had a better sear on i. There needed to be more of the red sauce too. N the veggies underneath need to be utilized. If these issues were fixed would be a better dishCuba 12$ (its like a pinapple rum cake) good not great 2/5 the cake was really moist n this dish didnt have a strong raw alcohol flavor which was good the icecream was amaizin it was really spicy but i felt that the jelly cubes n the rest of the components didnt really add anythingAdd more complexityMadagascar 12$ (chocolate cake with alot of other chocolate components) 3/5 this was better then the cuba but technique wise was flawed. The cake was really dry n the icecream was melting. N the truffles were way to hard. What was amaizing was the chocolate ganache it was the perfect balance of sweet n bitterness. Just fix issues and add more complexityPhilippines 12$ amaizin 5/5 (its like a mango mousse cake with mangos) the cake was supper moist and flavorful. The fried rice adds a savory crunch n loved the coconut my only complaint needs complexity something salty acidic n spicy to make it tastier for a 12$ dessert it has to be the best dessert ever",4.0,20,17,7

We had no reservations, but were seated right away around 11am. I LOVED how they took care of us. There was a little bit of confusion at first since our table was smack dab in the middle of two sections. They apologized for the wait (which wasn't long at all) and gave us mimosa's on the house. Now that's what I call excellent customer service! From there our experience just kept getting better.For my meal I had the Fried fish and waffles. I thought it was a really interesting dish.

But that was the case when we visited Portsmith during its first week.The theme here is fish, and it is carried out in almost every course. Even the sourdough bread has bonito flakes in it. That bread was a bit chewy for my taste, but the flavor was good and the accompanying black garlic butter was delicious.I preferred the Parker House Roll, which looked more like a pita and tasted like cheese bread.  Its companion old bay butter was also very tasty.We tried both the fancy and the fried oysters. Fancy oysters include a bit of foie gras, but the primary flavors are yuzu and green apple. They were delicious, but pricey at $5 each. Fried oysters coated in squid ink panko and topped with trout roe looked more interesting, but were just okay.The crispy octopus was indeed crispy, as it was completely coated in crunchy flakes. The accompanying citrus mayo and jam offset each other very nicely. One of the best octopus preparations in town.The best thing we had was the Cacio e Pepe, a pasta dish traditionally combining cheese and pepper, but here it was Uni butter and pepper. The fettucini was perfectly cooked, and the sauce was rich and delicious (although it needed additional salt and pepper to bring out the flavor).Charred shrimp cocktail was fairly conventional. The charring made the shrimp a bit too sturdy, but the cocktail sauce was excellent.The least successful dish was the Foie gras and donut, which sounded really fun, but wasn't. It was a generous serving of perfectly seared foie gras, crisp and caramelized on the surface, and runny on the inside. But the other ingredients on the plate didn't really work. The donut was small, tough, and flavorless, and was no substitute for a more traditional brioche or even pear or apple slice. And the strawberry ""jam"" was really bits of marinated strawberry, too chunky to provide the needed sweetness in each bite. It was also nearly impossible to combine the disparate ingredients into a composed bite, something essential with foie gras.The dessert list is very interesting, with each one accompanied by a different ice cream or sorbet. I opted instead for a sampling of those accompaniments. The chocolate sorbet was excellent, and the black rice ice cream exotic and intriguing. Tobacco ice cream was the most exciting idea, but just tasted like vanilla.There is an interesting wine list, with a small selection of nicely varietal wines by the glass.Service was almost too attentive. Three waiters, two bus boys and a manager kept clearing away every dish and glass, even when we wanted to hang onto them, and often while someone else was still eating. The restaurant wasn't very busy yet, so perhaps they just needed something to do, but it became funny after a while. It's commendable that they want to provide good service, but I think they need to relax just a tad!About half the tables are round and half are rectangular, and they're pretty small. This works okay for the rectangular ones, but the round ones don't work well for sharing plates. They don't take up any less space, and I think should be jettisoned in favor of the rectangular ones.One pet peeve is that at the beginning of the meal we were told that ""Chef wants you to order everything at once."" That's simply not acceptable in a sharing plates restaurant. You don't know everything you're going to want at the start of the meal, or what order you'll want it in. I've played this game before and ended up with a table full of food that the chef was supposedly going to course out for us. I'd rather do that myself.",4.0,4,4,2

We're visiting from San Francisco, and couldn't help comparing it to one of our favorite restaurants, Willi's Seafood and Raw Bar in Healdsburg, CA.They brought out a tasty amuse bouche of chilled cucumber soup with crab. Really nice start. I ordered a Double-brined martini, and the husband got an Old Money (Bulleit bourbon, Campari, walnut liquor). The cheesy Parker house rolls with Old Bay butter... amazing! They're $2 a roll, but you kind of want to order a dozen.The ""fancy oyster"" with foie gras torchon and yuzu is basically 3 of my all-time favorite ingredients combined. Decadent. Fabulous! The regular oysters were also very good, and served with a wedge of lemon as well as yuzu (I'm a yuzu fiend).Loved the flavor of the cacio e pepe with uni butter and caviar, though some of the pasta clumped up. We've made fresh pasta at home and at that thinness it is difficult to keep it from sticking. Would be nice if they can make sure it stays separated because the texture was great.King crab bun came on a Chinese style bao, which was unexpected. The bao could be fluffier... I do love frisée and the crab was fresh, but I'd skip this dish if we had another chance to eat here.Potato with crab butter is rich and could easily be split between 3 people. It's umami crazy with some sort of kombu dashi maybe? I kept smelling seaweed, which is fine by me!The servers were great, and on our way out, we were handed a little treat to go--some cookie crumble toffee? I wish the best of luck to Portsmith.

The cacio e pepe and mushroom tart came highly recommended. And they were fine. There was a lot of showmanship, with the food-runner slicing into the tart and pouring in the butter.

I tried the vegetarian sushi and my guy got the tempura.  All bento boxes cost $13 - $15 each, which seems to be a great deal, especially as they come with miso soup (or mushroom soup, for the veggie options) and salad.Our soups were great. The salads were not, as the overwhelming flavor was thinly shaved raw onion in such big quantities that it can't easily be fished out (why do people think salads are made better by huge piles of raw onion on top?) My veggie sushi was delicious, but each roll came with just four pieces. While I don't eat like a bird, it's not like I'm a totally voracious eater -- and the bento box simply didn't fill me up (especially because I couldn't finish the onion-y salad.) The tempura (which also came with four pieces of spicy shrimp roll) was a better value.Luckily, we were there on a Thursday, when hand rolls are half-price; we each ordered a delicious spicy tuna handroll for $3.50 to supplement our lunch and fill us up. In short, the sushi was good, but simply doesn't seem worth the price for what you get - *even* during the lunch special, let alone off the regular menu. If you're high-roller and money is no option for you, order up a storm and enjoy!When we got the bill, my husband noted that we could have ordered a pile of hand-rolls for a lot less money.

When it fills up it feels a little claustrophobic. Servers come around every now and then to take plates and refill drinks/water, but not frequently enough. Also our server forgot to put in the ""hot"" tapas we ordered, so there was a bit of a gap in our meal vs a steady stream of plates coming out.The sangria is terrible, I didn't finish my glass. The food - I honestly can't remember anything I liked very much. We had smoked salmon, jamon with manchego, seafood salad, two types of paella (iberico and the special with cuttlefish and cauliflower), chorizo and murcilla, croquetas, ensalada de pollo, pulpo de plancha, and patatas bravas. I'll skip the stuff that was just ok (not great and wouldn't order again) and cover the bad - patatas bravas were unlike any I've ever had, they were boiled potatoes covered in a weird sauce (not fried with hot sauce and aioli like I'm used to). The paellas were bad, like in a blind taste test with microwave rice-a-roni I would fail. Bland rice, low quality ingredients, 0 saffron flavor, not even a little hint of socarrat? Anyway, this isn't a place I'd return. In a city full of good food there's no reason to waste time here",2.0,3,0,1

We were initially confused if were in the right place because it's called Big Wig Tacos but outside the shop, it says Stubborn Tacos. Once inside, their pop dispenser said Stubborn pops but there was a mural on the upper wall with Big Wig on it. Slight identity crisis going on here.It was so incredibly cold inside, we had to move seats twice to try to get away from the big A/C but were still freezing. The chairs are odd, they are movable but a really heavy metal, I had to use all my force to move them as they scrapped along the floor. There is a super awesome mural with their branding but it's towards the ceiling so in the age of instagramming, this wasn't the best decision. Overall, I thought the dining room not well planned out. Plus when I went to the bathroom, I found it was right in front of an opened door kitchen with tons of vegetables and lettuce just sitting on the counter. Something grossed me out about seeing the ingredients for people's food right before & after peeing and not being monitored.So back to the experience, we walked in and it took several minutes for someone to come from the back to take our order. Their menu is pretty straight forward so we ordered some tacos, chips & salsa and a quesadilla. The chips & salsa comes with the same salsa found on table. We ate a few but tossed most. The quesadilla was pretty good, but holy grease explosion. I could not get passed the fact that it was swimming in oil.

Most of the customers at the restaurant were there for the restaurant week menu, it was unthinkable how each course could take so long to arrive. Appetizer: We got the octopus on edamame hummus. The hummus while green like edamame, tasted neither like edamame nor like hummus. It was a glorified union of the two that resulted in a final product that was worse than either of them. It had 0 resemblance to edamame nor hummus and instead left a sad and cheap sour cream taste in my mouth. The octopus was lukewarm, overly salted and seasoned, increasing my cardiovascular risk by 10%.Entree: We all got the steak with brussel sprouts and potatoesThe brussel sprouts and potatoes were prepared as if someone quickly dunked them into hot boiling water and pulled them out before they were even fully cooked.

The decorations inside were pretty cool. They had wine glasses/bottles hanging from the ceiling where the lights are and it looked pretty awesome.Apart from that, I thought this place was expensive for the food they offered. I had the braised short rib and thought it was OK. For a $34 price tag, I didn't really enjoy it as much as other short ribs I've had at other restaurants with a $20 price tag. The accompanied potato dish tasted heavily of butter but I still scarfed it down.My other friends got the shrimp appetizer, buratta app, duck/pasta entree, and the chocolate dessert. I had a taste of the shrimp appetizer and I thought it was on point. The buratta app. was alright and didn't do much for me. The mushroom pasta seemed like it was loaded with heavy cream, and both people who ordered it said it was far too rich. I didn't get to eat the duck but the person seemed to enjoy it.

That was slightly annoying since we had to sit in the front for around 15 minutes until 5 of our 6 guests were here. I didn't mind that as much, but I did mind them not being able to split the check separately. Every restaurant should be able to split a check as many times as possible, especially if we are paying $40/head.",2.0,1,1,0

While they have an extensive vegetarian menu,   the vegan options were a bit limited. But alas, our server was phenomenal and helped her choose an amazing brussel sprout salad with a somewhat bland black couscous side we shared. On the flip side, I had a decent braised rib served on a deliciously prepared bed of buttered turnips. The side of potato and kale colcannon was OK (super hot) but was just too rich for my taste. We were led to the third floor elevator after checking in with the host (weird) but once we sat, the decor was wonderful. From the massive hanging wine bottle ""chandelier,"" to the large, mid-century windows, everything was classy and well done.

It had a noticeable truffle flavor and was savory. For entrées, we ordered the Berkshire Pork, 30 Day Dry Aged NY Strip, 50 Day Dry Aged Steak, and Rohan Duck. Mine was the duck. The NY Strip was covered in an abundant amount of truffle shavings, but you couldn't taste the truffle flavor at all. Save yourself the money, and don't opt for the truffle shavings.

We spent 2.5 hours in the restaurant and still hadn't gotten dessert. (For the record, we only ordered salads and entrees prior to that-- and we didn't ask for special accommodations off the menu). While pouring water, the server spilled and poured ice into my entree (um, thanks). Food was disappointing. The warm squash & beet salad was delicious, but the cauliflower vegetarian entree I ordered was terrible. I'd advocate that they should remove it from the menu. It was, essentially, steamed cauliflower on a plate (two piles of steamed cauliflower florets) separated by sautéed mushrooms (those were delicious). I ate the mushrooms and left 90% of the cauliflower of the plate because it was boring. The waiter didn't even bother to ask if there was a problem with my dish when they cleared. If you are going to go to the trouble of having a separate vegetarian menu, it's probably worth investing time in developing those dishes. I left before dessert was even served bc I didn't want to spend another 45 minutes there. The space is beautiful, but if last night was any indication, this place is on its last legs.

Before our visit: we came here for my friends 30th birthday. She had a VERY difficult time getting a reservation, to the point that her boyfriend had to go in TWICE AND call the manager before we were able to get a table. The Visit: This place is PACKED. Maybe if I was 21 and it was my first time going to brunch this would be a good place to go, but I'm not, I'm 30 and I appreciate a good brunch with good service and the ability to have a conversation. $40 brunch was just okay, I definitely did not eat $40 worth of food, especially after I saw some drunk 19 year old looking girl with her hair in the oysters (I kindly let her know that was disgusting) because she could barely stand up. $20 for mimosas is a good deal, minus the fact that our waitress was waaaaayyyyy too busy. Forget trying to get to the bar for drinks, it was slammed too. I DO NOT recommend a table, the booth is the way to go. We were constantly having to tell people our table was reserved and since we were right next to the bar we were constantly being pushed and shoved by people waiting to get drinks. The problems with the service are not the servers or bartenders fault, they were understaffed for the crowd and the place was too crowded for them to effectively do their job. I do appreciate the waitress making every effort to make us happy but I will not be back. Will say, the DJ was lit. Great combination of new music and throwbacks. The dancers on the stage looked like I do after a few cocktails on a Saturday night- could have done without them. Save yourself $60 and go somewhere else for brunch.

People were wasted and one mimosa away from passing out at their tables. One girl was wearing a dress in a big booth, and she was doing high kicks while seated, crotch out for the world to see. It was THAT kind of a brunch. Let's start with the food. It's a buffet, and there's a lot of food. It's the biggest buffet/spread that I've seen at a Chicago buffet. They have a wall of donuts, meats and cheeses, pizza, mini sliders, shrimp cocktail, oysters, a waffle station, mac 'n cheese, bacon, an omelette station, tacos, a mini dessert table... Truly, it's quite the spread. Now, the one and biggest downside about this enormous spread is that the food just isn't that great. I tried a lot of different items from the buffet, but there was nothing that had me wanting more. Rather, it had me on a search, desperate to find something spectacular, because surely, something amazing must exist among all that food. The huge roast thing they were serving looked so fatty and disgusting that I couldn't even bring myself to try it. The shrimp cocktail is frozen and chewy. The mac 'n cheese was cold. The pizza had good flavor, but it was so greasy. It's like the sentiment is there behind all of the items, but there's something that's just not quite right. The donut wall is cool, and they're good donuts (mostly cake donuts).Let's talk service. The waitresses are wearing these tight booty shorts, with their booties literally hanging out the back. It's aggressive for any time of the day (after all, we're not at Hooters), but especially for brunch. Attire aside, they keep the mimosas flowing the whole time. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. The staff does a great job of making sure you always have a full drink, and you never even have to ask for a refill. I was honestly impressed with their ability to keep the champagne flowing like that. For service, I'd give it 4 stars. Overall, I'm glad I tried out this brunch, but I'm not anxious to go back again. If there was a birthday or some occasion where we were just looking to get wasted, I'd consider going back. This is a place you come to get DRUNK. It's not a place you go to have amazing food or to catch up with a girlfriend (you won't be able to hear anything she says). Pro Tip: 1) Make an early reservation. Apparently, after you're done eating, you can go upstairs and continue to enjoy mimosas as part of the $20 mimosa package until 3 pm! It's no wonder everyone is hammered. 2) Don't bring your parents here or anyone who is easily offended. You may also want to bring ear plugs. The music gets progressively louder as the day continues.

This is pretty much like a daytime party. People are dressed up as if they are about to hit the club, so I can say that I definitely under dressed. It was no problem though. The all you can eat brunch buffet was $40. The food was fantastic. I had the pulled pork sandwich, the beef brisket, the roasted broccoli & brussel sprouts, shrimp, macaroni and cheese, pasta salad, and a lot of the yummy desserts! The only thing I had that I didn't really like was the macaroni and cheese, which could have used more seasoning. That brisket though.... I've honestly been thinking about it ever since it was so good. I also loved the three flavors of thick cut bacon! All the desserts were delicious, and fancy. They have a nice donut wall. I honestly didn't think the donuts would be that great, but I was wrong. Bottomless mimosas were $20 more, but definitely worth it. My glass did not go empty one time the entire time I was here (from 12:30-4pm), and that's saying a lot because I can throw back a mimosa! I loved the selection of juices (orange, blood orange, peach, & pineapple) they offered to mix with our champagne. My total for brunch & bottomless mimosas after tax was $67, which is more than I would normally spend on brunch, but I think that it was worth the amount considering that we were there all the way until 4pm, we all got a few plates, and our glasses were never empty. That being said, the only thing that put me off was the fact that most of the clientele was on the young side (mid 20's), the vibe was night club-ish, and after a few hours when they tried to kick one of the patrons out there was a fight that started inside at the entrance and was taken outside by security.

Qum71kqlxeK9MJ5ptfcJFw,ID-0tVdM9YatcHzjDfiofg,eaIHxfMQ7PHuA0Q9ynwRGw,1/29/2018,"I have been to Fremont Saturday brunch twice and after brunch to just party upstairs once. My last time here was for a birthday brunch and the birthday girl was told over the phone that you had to pay for a table to be able to go upstairs. When we got there we asked our server if that was true and she told us it wasn't that anyone could go up there. (Miscommunication or trying push for tables?- either way this is not the first time I have heard this in the recent months and for that I will knock a star off) Brunch has a lot of different options from omlettes and yogurt to smoked meats and seafood! They have a desert area with all types of individual cakes and cupcakes. You will definitely find things you like as well as some others that won't please your palette. They also have bottomless mimosa packages as well as bloody mary packages. They have difference juice carafes to grab some mixer for your mimosas as well. The prices are pretty standard for River North Chicago. Total for both food and drink package has came out to about $65. Upstairs they had an awesome DJ that played anything form oldies to spanish hits to top 40 and hip hop. It really was a great mix of music that appealed to everyone there. They have a couch area that you pay to drink and sit at and then there are a couple bar tables where anyone can sit. There are two bars upstairs which I find great when it starts getting packed up there. Definitely a fun little day club until you find people that cannot handle their bottomless mimosa packages. LOL. I did see bartenders and servers cutting people off which I think is great and very needed in during bottomless deals, some people just do not know how to pace themselves. All in all fun place for avid day drinkers!",4.0,1,1,1

That is a huge win for a Saturday reservation in Chicago.2. I love the vibes at Fremont! We sat upstairs and the rooftop was open. It is perfect on a beautiful summer day!3. The DJ played awesome music. The volume was loud enough that you could enjoy it like you were a part of one big brunch party (because it was one big brunch party) but you could still have a conversation at the table. Another win!4. The all-you-can-eat buffet selection was on point! I literally hit every group on the food pyramid in one meal. Some would call that nauseating. I call it epic. I mean what's not to like about a donut that you hand pick off a wall?5. Bottomless mimosas for an extra $20!? Okay! They have a bar where you can choose your own mixers, and the wait staff is constantly walking around refilling your glasses with more champagne. I was a huge fan of the variety of mixers. We got orange juice, raspberry juice, strawberry juice and blackberry juice. all were equally amazing!Why my review is missing the last two stars:1. The service was rocky at first. We had to wait a while for our first round of champagne to start. There was a lot of confusion on whether we were getting a bottle for our table, whether we had to go get the champagne from the bar every time we wanted a refill, or whether the waitress was going to periodically return to the table with champagne refills. We ended up having to go to the bar to get our first round. If that's the system, great! It just would have been nice to know that before playing a guessing game.2. The price we paid for both brunch and mimosas was fine but the service should reflect what we are paying for the meal. Our waitress never came to check on us. Random waitresses would stop by and replenish our champagne, but nobody asked how the meal was going or if we needed anything.3. The quality of the food was not worth $40. The burgers were room temperature and the bun was stale by the time I ate it. My suggestion would be keeping the burgers in warmers and the buns separate so the meat stays warm and the buns still stay fresh.Overall, this is a great place to take out of town guests, host a celebration, or simply turn up on a weekend. If the service improves during my future visits to Fremont, so will my review.",3.0,9,5,8

There was a donut wall with fresh house-made donuts. A raw bar with shrimp and oysters. A waffle and omelette bar. There was also a meat station with sausage and some other roasted meat.  There was also a chili bar And other miscellaneous food options (mac and cheese, pork sliders, hot dogs, pork belly, bacon, etc).

The raisins add just enough yumminest. I will say that the icing is a bit over kill I ate most of my portion without it.

Bacon wrapped dates - tasty but the bacon was a bit overcooked. Burrata - delicious! The soft mozzarella with creamy center works perfectly with  miche, fennel mostarda, and cape gooseberry. The dish comes with speck ham, which is very good and not gamy at all. Chicken Fried Lobster - breaded fried lobster, similar to the one you get at a Chinese restaurant. It was just ok.

Don't judge a book by its cover. This place is beautiful on the inside. The vibe and people makes you feel energetic and young. I loved the outdoor patio and the fireplace. There's both an indoor and outdoor bar if you're looking just to drink or to wait at while getting seated. Keep in mind that the bar is also full service, so it's a little awkward to wait around if you're just looking for a drink without getting a bar seat and the service is also a bit slower.Here's the food breakdown:The cocktails are delicious. I had ""da bomb"" which was literally da bomb. It reminded me of a boozy version of Vietnamese pickeled lemonade which is like a salted lemonade. (4/5)Spanish Octopus (4/5)Very delicious appetizer. Octopus isn't easy to execute. Hanger Steak (3.5/5)I am a carnivore at heart but the element on that dish that I liked the most was the polenta which deserves a 5/5. It was so delicious and creamy! The steak was cooked well but not nearly as memorable for a steak dish.Halibut (1.5/5)It tasted like a waste of potential. White fish is a double edged sword. The beauty in it is that is a great medium to absorb flavor. The flip side is that on its own, it has a very subtle flavor and can be easily overshadowed. The way it was prepared was bland. The vegetables did not enhance the dish either. They just seemed like filler.

This is normally a good sign. A very friendly man talked to us and lend us inside. Inside is very small and it was even more packed that I assumed. I guess there was a pub crawl going on? Anyways, we get led to a table and it was horribly loud. Can't discount them on that since it's out of their control. The man sits us and does a quick explanation on the menu and says the waitress will be here soon. Anyways, a short time later,  shows up and she explains the menu again. Luckily my girlfriend was able to listen since I didn't hear a word anyway says. We ordered Crab Devil Eggs. Overall, it was good and it did contain a decent amount of eggs but I don't think the Crab was needed since the egg mixture overpowered the crab which was lost. Still a very good deviled egg thoMy girlfriend ordered the Lobster BLT and I ordered the Lobster Burger. Both came out fairly quickly was a bonus and both came out full to the plates. I was not expecting this much food but boy were they delicious. The BLT was full of Lobster Salad and my Burger had a good amount of Lobster on top of it. It even contained a claw or two plus whatever else they used. The truffle aoili was full of flavor and the fries had a good crisp and salted nicely. The cocktails were good, expensive but good. It wasn't watered down or lacking in alcohol tho. I loved the Strawberry Mojito and the Horchata Colada. Overall, bill was a high but we a total of 3 cocktails, crab deviled eggs, and two entrees with Lobster so it was reasonable to an extent considered the amount of food and Lobster. I do see myself going back here in the near future. Hopefully it won't be as loud and packed for an early dinner tho. We like to eat dinner early to avoid the crowd but whatever.

Do you really want to mix lobster with beef or bacon in the same bite?? Isn't that a bit OVERKILL? Yes, it kinda is. And yet... like me, you'd do it anyway. The fries that came with our 'sandwiches' were pretty meh...they tasted like they'd been around a while, so we skipped them. Mac & cheese has a little something....nutmeg? mustard? both?...mixed in. I was fine with it; my companion didn't care for it. I think bacon and/or truffle coulda kicked it up, but of course that's an upcharge :) Maybe the point of the food here is to Overdo It?

The food was pretty decent, but I found it to be overpriced for the quality (which was really disappointing because Lettuce restaurants are pretty reliable for their good value) and we had a bizarre service issue. I will come back to try the pizza, but we a pretty much done with the entrees. Here's what we ate:Bread with Balsamic garlic: SOOO yummy. I am not typically a bread eater, but this combo was definitely worth it.Calamari: Ehh. The marinara it  was served with didn't seem like the best pairing. After a bite or two we started fantasizing about the seasoning and dipping sauces the come withe the calamari at cafe baba reeba. Also, this came with a single two inch piece of toasted bread...which was super confusing (I think it might have been accidentally added to the plate because it was so disproportionate to the volume of calamari served).Salmon and Shrimp with lobster sauce (special): This dish was PERFECTION. The salmon was cooked perfectly;  the lobster sauce was creamy and delicious; everything worked well together.Scallops over sweet potato mash: The scallops were slightly overcooked (this is a pet peeve of mine). I think the issue was that the brown butter they were booked it was a tad too brown when they were seared. The sweet potato mash was over salted and had a weird combo of overbrowned root veggies and bacon on top...this were overpowering. I would probably rethink this dish entirely. Probably put the scallops over a nice risotto or something more mild that it's easy to taste them.Black Old Fashioned: My husband thought this was excellent.Ricotta cheese cheesecake: Italian fudge sauce is like an oxymoron. Fudge is not an italian thing (we asked for the fudge sauce on the side). The fudge sauce was good, as was the cheesecake itself, but the kitchen kind of ruined the dish by sprinkling a ton of powdered sugar over the dish/cake. This is a huge no no in my book...kind of like the dreaded mint leaf some places add to a dessert. It was an absolute turn off; not an attractive decoration...just don't do it!Service issue: We asked our server for straws on two separate occasions. He forgot both times and wouldn't acknowledge that he had been asked. After the first half of the meal, I assumed he was swamped and  I ended up leaving the restaurant and going to the bar to get straws for the table. He saw me walking back with the straws (I smiled at him and held them up)  and didn't say anything...even when he served the rest of the meal, it was very odd.

Many times he'd walk by without acknowledging any of his tables...even if you politely tried to make eye contact. This was frustrating. Similar was the water service. It was awesome to have sparkling water offered with no extra charge, but whoever was filling water pretty much disappeared after the first ten minutes. I shouldn't have to crane my neck trying to get that basic thing...water. I love some sparkling water and was craving more of the bubbly good stuff!!",4.0,1,1,1

According to Osteria Via Stato.This is exactly what everyone who attended the Limoncello Course at Osteria Via Stato did on July 22, 2017!  Participants learned how to make limoncello ""the Italian way.""  The course highlighted the restaurant's Chef David DiGregorio's 'cello program which is seasonal and highlights various fruits and ingredients which are infused with grain alcohol or Vodka at their peak.There were approximately fifty people in attendance and the course was $20.00 per person. The course provided an informative history of Italian limoncello production from the regions of the islands of Capri, Ischia, and Procida; the Sorrento region; and the Amalfi Coast.  The course was based upon Osteria Via Stato's house made recipe and tasting the process of limoncello as it evolves over time.  All participants also received a complimentary recipe card and a generous sample of house made and creatively bottled limoncello to take home.Participants were seated at tables and learned the steps of successfully peeling the skin from lemons ensuring not to have any pith or the white part of the lemon rind in the peeling process.  Participants then were walked through the process verbally and tasting wise with the production of limoncello.  Participants tasted what the process was like at three days, one week, and finally the finished product.Upon the completion of the course about limoncello preparation, the class was provided with tasting samples of seasonal raspberrycello and chocolacello.  The course was lead by Wine and Beverage Manager Matthew Dolin.  Mr. Dolan gave a thoughtful and informative introduction and overview of the process after which he circulated around to all of the tables engaging in pouring the cellos and interacting and answering all questions by participant guests.  Mr. Dolin also stated that this was the second year that Osteria Via Stato has held this course and that it is open to the public.I wish they would offer this course on a more regular basis as they make other seasonal cellos such as blood orange cello and grapefruit cello which would be fun to sample.The cellos (Limoncello, Chocolacello, and Seasonal Cellos) are available on the Osteria Via Stato Dessert Menu at the restaurant listed under the ""Digestivi & After Dinner Drinks"" under the section of ""House Made Liqueurs.""  Truly a magnificent and unique concept for a Chicago Italian restaurant to make house made limoncello and other cellos and to invite the public in to learn about and enjoy ""the fruits of their labor.""FYI-Fun Facts1. Limoncello should be served cold2. In Italy unique cellos such as Limoncello of Pistachio are available3. It is my understanding that individuals can purchase limoncello or their seasonal cellos by the bottle by calling the restaurant in advance as the restaurant makes cellos on a regular basis.",5.0,2,3,0

I really enjoyed their bread and oil, plus the (roasted?) garlic cloves they give with it.I had a glass of wine from the northwestern Piedmont region, which was nice and dry, flavorful, and enhanced by probably the biggest bulb on a wine glass I've ever seen.Each of us ordered our own dinners. I had the short ribs with a side of pasta cacio e pepe, my brother had the wild mushroom ricotta cavatelli, friend 1 had chicken Mario, and friend 2 had a meatloaf special. Everyone thought their food was fantastic! The pastas are all clearly handmade, cooked perfect al-dente and were super flavorful. The last time I had cacio e pepe was in Rome last summer, and I was very impressed at how close Osteria Via Stato's was to what I remember having. Spot on!My short ribs were also delicious. Perfectly melt-in-your-mouth tender with a nice zing in the wine sauce, as well as the potato puree on the bottom. I've had quite a few amazing short ribs, and while this one isn't #1, it is definitely towards the top of the list.The service was another high point of our dinner. Although it did take quite awhile for us to get our food, we were in no hurry and our server, whose name escapes me, took good care of us as well as was engaging and even a little witty and funny to our group of 4 younger guys. All too often servers are too quiet, and sometimes even too talkative, but this was perfect.Overall we really enjoyed our dinner at Osteria Via Stato. It is a straightforward place with a simple in a good way menu, high quality ingredients and good service. It isn't exactly inexpensive, but many choices are very reasonable, and they have an interesting family style prix fixe option as well.A nice, easy option for quality River North Italian food without splurging.Will be back for sure!",5.0,1,0,0

We sat outside - the ambiance was perfect and the drape lighting was romantic. There happened to be a street singer/keyboardist on the other side of the street which put the icing on top of the cake in terms of a perfect date night out.The bread basket was the best bread basket I've ever had period. It was warm, perfectly toasted, and the inside of the bread was full, perfectly soft and chewy. The olive oil with pieces of mushroom - SO GOOD. I could have ate the bread basket for a meal and called it a day.For appetizers we ordered the octopus - my husband loved this. It was very tender and not rubbery at all (which I personally find strange since I expect my octopus to have a slightly chewy texture, but that doesn't seem in vogue). It was VERY oily. Sitting in 1 cm of oil. But he liked it.I ordered the seasonal market risotto which happened to be sausage risotto with snap peas. It was flavorful, al dente for sure, but slightly salty and heavy. I wished there were more snap peas to lighten the dish, and the sausage pieces were very small. My husband ordered Chicken Mario which had a delicious crispy layer and was tender/perfectly cooked on the inside.

When you show up, you can't tell if it's open seating or wait at the doors for someone to seat you. Everytime I've gone, I've tested both. Once I've Waited for a good 7 min at the doors to be seated with obvious open seats available. I've also attempted to seat myself after that experience and waited about 20 min before a server came by where we were sitting to realize we haven't been helped yet. Yes even after flagging someone down.2) Touch Tunes jukebox. So for me, any bar that has a touchtunes jukebox is a instant try out to give the place to go. I enjoy having a few drinks with friends, order some food, and throw on some music we enjoy. Well of course, that's the purpose of having a jukebox right? Well, at The Green Door Tavern, it depends. First time I've went, the scenario I mentioned just now is what happened. The next 3 times after that, not so much. One time, the bartenders turned off the jukebox mid song to play their music off his iPod up at the bar without considering the fact that someone had just paid money to use the jukebox. The following 2 times, the bartenders would see what music is queued up, and if they didn't like it, they'd forcefully play music they wanted ahead of songs that have been paid for by customers. Seriously. We even called out one of the bartenders when we noticed they were doing it. That's crazy shady, because you're taking money from the patrons that are paying to hear their music, obviously paying for food/drinks to enjoy at the same time, but while you wait for your song you'll never hear it come on. The app tells you what songs are next and in queue and can only be moved back if someone pays an extra coin to get their song in ""next"". That obviously costs extra money. Sure some people do that, but Everytime one of our songs was next, it'd get bump back 4 songs back by random tracks at the last second.

mKj4H2yPEz4Hy87TJqbUIg,zXDVdB7jofrt1IWODlOtUA,DS7y3kLe7mk6Ivfs8VKXJg,2/16/2018,"Words can't even begin to describe what a complete package Beatrix is.I came here for breakfast on an early Chicago morning while staying for a work trip and was instantly greeted by a warm, cozy atmosphere and upbeat service. The restaurant can get busy (always a good thing) but it never feels rushed or pushy like more popular brunch spots in Chicago. The food itself was great; I have 0 complaints on that front and the mimosa (or 2 or 3) that I had was standard fare. Things I tried & liked:Avocado Toast - Topped with fresh avocado, the light and airy bread pairs well with the grains and greens put on top. For those looking for a more citrusy avocado toast-- look elsewhere. Otherwise, definitely try this side!House-Made Belgian Style Waffle - The name is a bit deceiving; you get 4 small waffles with a beautifully done, light sweet cream reminiscent of mascarpone. The waffles are topped with fresh strawberries and garnished with a small helping of mint leaves and syrup. The dish is great; everything pairs well and it's not too heavy. However, it is a relatively small portion so if you're in the mood for waffles/pancakes, then go for the lemon pancakes (which offer a larger portion size).Light & Fluffy Lemon Pancakes - These are pretty straighforward. You get 2 light and fluffy lemon infused pancakes topped with powdered sugar, lemon zest, and blackberries. You get Beatrix's wonderful syrup on the side. They taste great (though a bit egg-y for my palette) and are filling without bloating you afterwards. Mimosas - The mimosas are standard fare, though you can get them in orange, blue, or red. They're worth having, though I believe they'd be more fairly priced around $6 or $7 each.Overall, Beatrix is a fantastic breakfast/brunch spot. While it may not be as popular as other restaurants, it's a welcome addition to the food scene in Chicago that doesn't have ridiculously long wait times. Everything from the food, the service, and the ambiance is well-rounded and feels like a complete package. When tables are full, I recommend sitting at the bar to avoid having to wait in line.",5.0,1,1,0

However, I really enjoyed it! Even though it was more on the well side, I was able to easily cut through it without a steak knife. The chimichurri was a nice touch. I also thought the portion was fine - plenty of meat! I mean a meat serving is really only supposed to be palm-sized right?! I subbed out the golden hash browns with the sliced tomato & avocado side. No complaints! *EGGS YOUR WAY - (golden hash browns, whole grain toast, choice of brown sugar bacon or our chicken sausage $11.95): boyfriend ordered this & thoroughly enjoyed it. Chicken sausage was in a patty form as opposed to sausage form. Beatrix also serves bulletproof coffee (coffee with butter & coconut oil), but at $8.95, I wasn't sure I wanted to bite the bullet (ha, dad jokes.) I also went up to look at the case of tasty pastries, but also held off because I was very full from the breakfast plates! 48/365",4.0,5,4,3

Luckily, I factored in ""getting lost"" time so we still made our reservation.Located in the lobby of ALoft hotel, the restaurant can accommodate both small and large groups. I loved the cute wood pendant lights and criss-cross wood beams. Even bar seating, something that I typically avoid, looked interesting, mostly because it was located next to this amazing pastry bar. Although it was still early morning, there was already a wait. The menu was healthier than most and diverse, including cauliflower grits, shakshouka, and chicken tinga. My sister picked the ahi tuna bowl and I had the steak and eggs (even though I wanted the lemon pancakes); we were both interested filling up with protein before our flights. The steak was cooked to a medium-rare, tender, and served with grilled shishisto peppers, eggs, hash browns, and toast. It was okay, but not fantastic, or even memorable.

First, I got a Mocha for my pastry because I love dipping, plus I needed to wake up :)  For breakfast, I ordered the Spicy Chicken Tinga (spicy tomato sauce, poached eggs, kale, feta, warm naan). It was full of flavor and also nicely presented. The bold sauce wasn't too spicy either, just the right amount of heat. It was the perfect dish for the cold weather in my opinion.

The lemon pancakes however were really good, just pretty thin so not what I'd order if I wanted something filling. What does (and did) warrant a second visit was their honey butter icing cinnamon roll. By chance when we went Friday morning they had one left and I decided to try it. Best decision ever.

The Roost has been on my list to check out and decided to check out the River West location due to the closeness of the downtown area. First off, the interior is tiny. It can probably fit up to 6-8 people. So good luck trying to get a seat if it's not packed. Second off, expect a decent amount of wait time on your chicken. It's not like Popeyes, KFC where you just walk in, the chicken is pre made and they dump the chicken in the buckets. This place actually seems to make their fried chicken on the spot! So beware of waiting for your chicken!Now onto the chicken. I decided to get the 1/2 chicken. They allow you to get 2 different flavors so I decided to do the original and the Nashville hot. For sides I got the Mac and Cheese and potato chips. The chicken is very fresh tasting. Straight from the fryer so beware it's HOT! The meat is very tender. The original was good with flavor but the Nashville Hot was exploding with flavor. The pepper and spices got me coughing and almost choking at one point but I will not let that deter me from enjoying this chicken. It was really really good! I enjoyed it a lot, I remember when I went to Gus' Fried Chicken, felt it was underwhelming, along with the Budlong in the Revival Hall, but Roost Carolina Kitchen is one I will remember. The Mac and Cheese was solid. I love cheesy cheese so if you do too, you will like it. The chips were decent too, nothing special to be honest. All in all really solid place. It's not going to be cheap like Popeyes or KFC but if you're willing to splurge on fried chicken I recommend this place!",4.0,2,1,1

The thigh was dry, but the wing was juicy. It did not have a lot of flavors. The biscuit was not warm or fluffy. The mac-n-cheese was way too peppery. The Nashville hot chicken was also a bit dry.

It combines a charming aesthetic with a friendly staff, but unfortunately that's where the list of good things ends. I've been to Bernie's twice, and both times were bitterly disappointing. My first visit was inspired by word of mouth about their signature appetizer, the Lamb Hashwi. I was extremely excited and my server only heightened my anticipation by claiming it was the best lamb dish he had ever tried. And then he forgot to put my order in- what a letdown...  Bernie's also is well-known for their burgers, so I was still excited about that, except they add pork to every single one. As someone, who cannot have pork I asked to have a beef patty, and they refused to accommodate me. I ended up having to spend an unreasonable amount of money on a turkey burger, one which did not even come with a side. I ended up going back to Bernie's against my better judgment, as part of a small group dinner (8 people). I ordered an Old Fashioned to start my night and after a lengthy delay was served a Manhattan. I understand that human error occurs, but twice in two visits displays an apathy towards customers. I guess this should be the part where I get excited about finally trying the Lamb Hashwi. It was good, up until the point that it got nearly half my group sick with FOOD POISONING. The icing on top of this was that one of my friends ordered a key lime sundae for dessert, and they didn't have any, which would be fine, EXCEPT for the fact that the explanation we received was that the Head Chef was taking it off the menu. Here's an idea- if something on the menu is not going to be served, take it OFF the menu. Ultimately, Bernie's is an affront to a vibrant and thriving food scene in Chicago.

We got there at the perfect time - 11am. 12pm is when the crowds started rolling in so the hour earlier pays off. I ordered the Fried Egg Sandwich without bacon. Rather, bacon on the side. The first time the food came out, it sadly had some bacon on it, so I had to send it back. The eggs were also very runny (a big no-no for me) so they fixed that as well. Honestly, the sandwich (after the first changes) was perfect. It was a tad bit messy, but that's a-okay when the taste is as bountiful and overwhelming in the best way possible as was this. The flavors combined take your taste buds on a journey through brunching heaven. My friend also tried the avocado toast. This is far from ""basic"" as the goat cheese and the sauce take it to a completely different level. She also loved that they were cut into pieces, so it made it easier to bite and eat and pick up.

Between the fabulous rooftop and the great food, I was ready for a great dining experience. I visited with my best friend for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. Location: Bernie's is located on the west edge of River North. It is still a busy part of downtown,  but tucked away from the places that are high risk factors for being tourist traps. Decor: Very modern. Somewhat rustic. Open floor plan. Only decorative things that stood out to me were the light fixtures in the main dining room. Service: Strange. Borderline nonexistent. We were greeted by a bubbly host. Our table wasn't ready when we arrived. That was fine. Several minutes later he returned and led us to our table. Here is where the problems began. It took literally 13 minutes before our waitress came to take our drink orders. It took close to the same amount for her to come back with the drinks (I literally opted for water, my BFF the mimosa), which then she took our order. The biggest disappointment was that it took 27 minutes before our meals made it to the table.Food: I am still shocked towards Bernie's for these two dishes. While they may look appealing to the eye, to the tastebuds...thats a completely different story. Croque Madame: Dijon. Nothing but dijon...did I taste. Although the mornay sauce was quite tasty (on its own and on the side fries I opted for instead of salad), there was so much dijon and grain mustard slathered on this sandwich, that it completely overpowered the gruyere and the ham. It even plowed right through the sea of mornay. How could the chef think that's okay? I'm a big boy (physically). I always finish my meals. This was the first time in a long time that I left more than half of my entree sitting on the plate before vacating the premises. Jamon y Queso: Y'all. I swear I'm not trying to be rude when I say this, but from the second this concoction hit my mouth, I literally gagged. The texture of this egg mixed with the goat cheese was NOT a pleasant taste or consistency. I forced myself to swallow it, but let it be known I promptly asked for a dessert menu in an attempt to get rid of every trace of that bite. Our waitress informed us that because the restaurant was ""so busy"" they didn't have time to create an official dessert menu for that day but there were a selection of sweet tasting a la carte Items we could order for dessert.

When we arrived at lunchtime I was initially disappointed with the very limited menu compared with dinner, but as I watched the food emerge from the kitchen I realized there was really quite a variety. I ordered a build it yourself salad, and as I waited for it, watching the scrumptious looking BLTs and burgers go past I was starting to get lunch envy. But boy, what a fantastic salad it turned out to be. A top ten of all time level salad! I selected romaine but got mixed greens, which turned out to work much better with the other ingredients, whether by accident or knowledgeable salad making lore I don't know. My other ingredients were cucumber, yellow raisins, red peppers, pecans and radishes. I also added a protein, the sweet potato falafel. The ingredients came together in that rare magical way to make something far greater than the individual components, particularly because of the amazing tarragon ranch dressing. (I will have to try making that at home!) Oh, and those sweet potato falafel pieces were perfect, not the least bit oily, and wonderfully seasoned.

Although the highly anticipated blueberry crisp is no longer offered on their winter menu, I still left with a smile on my face and happy belly.(1) Lamb Hashwi. This dish is KILLER. Hummus mixed with pine nuts, pomegranate, olive oil and ground lamb was an absolutely excellent starter. The most delicious hummus I've tried thus far.(2) Turkey Burger. Although the name may sound typical and ordinary, it's everything but that! The turkey burger distinguishes it from others from being mixed with feta cheese, marinara and sriracha sauce that keeps it moist and bombin'. The half melting warm pita bread that can barely hold up the burger is just the cherry on top.(3) Apple caramel crisp with burnt caramel gelato. Another winner.

We ordered the ""omakase,"" which they claimed was customized to your personal preference but it was anything but that. In my opinion, the omakase was basically just the most expensive items from the menu thrown together without any sort of thought or class.We waited over 40 minutes for our first course to arrive from the time we sat down. The disaster did not stop there, however. Every subsequent dish was brought out after unacceptably long wait times of 25-35 minutes. The entire experience took over 2 hours and a majority of our courses were just skewers. While the food was not awful, the bill for two people was well over $200, extremely overpriced--I am fine with paying that much for a well-deserved experience, but the service here was absolutely terrible.I will never be returning to Katana again. The food was ridiculously overpriced, the service was unbelievably slow, and my special request to try chicken cartilage was forgotten even though my waiter promised to include it in our ""omakase.""

Now I don't like seafood, so my review should only be considered by people that do not eat seafood. I had their chicken breast ($13). The waiter said it is a very high quality piece of meat. It was super moist, as in too moist for my liking. For high quality meat, I thought it tasted bad. It came with several sauces, all of which were ok. The problem was I didn't like the chicken so it didn't matter how good the sauce was. For $13 this was the worst tasting chicken breast I have ever overpaid for. The meat doesn't come with anything, so I ordered the cauliflower $12 to split with my friend. The side is good for 2-4 people. The cauliflower was pretty good - it had a sweeter green sauce and parmesan on it. The highlights of this restaurant are the atmosphere, the service, and the dessert. The restaurant has a huge open layout and is very clean cut. I like that you can see the chef stations and that the tables are unique fixtures. Our server was fantastic, he was very personable and checked in on us often. The ""carnival"" lived up to my expectations. It is a dessert hidden in a dome of cotton candy. When they come to the table they light on fire the cotton candy which slowly reveals the dessert. The dessert itself is a brownie topped with a peanut buttter semifreddo, meringue, and pretzels.

Upscale and trendy Katana opened over the summer right next to House Of Blues, serving a fare of Japanese cuisine, which includes robatayaki (robata for short). Robata refers to a method of cooking, similar to barbecue, in which items of food on skewers are slow-grilled over a special type of hot charcoal (Japanese binchotan, log-shaped charcoal made from a variety of oak). I am a huge fan of sushi and ramen, it's wonderful  to see that this type of grilling is taking Chicago by storm. For cold dish starters we tried the hanabi and toro tataru. The hanabi consists of a generous portion of spicy tuna over a perfectly rectangular piece of crispy seasoned rice. I don't know why it works, but it is delicious. The crunchy exterior of the rice with the chewiness of the inside of the rice just works well together with the creamy texture of the spicy tuna. It's an interesting mouth feel experience.  The Toro tataru with premium uni, was okay. Though I don't think it was worth the $42 price tag.  The dish was no more than 4 tablespoon worth of tuna, lightly sprinkled with caviar,  and very little uni. The robata grill, served with 3 house sauces, (skewers serving was 2oz, non skewer serving is 3 oz):Gyu: age rib eye, was not seasoned very well and in my opinion, overcooked and a little tough to chew for such a small morsel. Wagyu Kosho: US wagyu seasoned with pepper sauce was delicious and melt in your mouth tenderness.Hatsu: chicken hearts. This might sound off putting, but it was beautifully grilled, lightly brushed with some type of sauce. It tender and juicy like a filet steak. Sounds weird,  but we ordered seconds because it was that good.Suzuki: the Chilean seabass was advised to us as a Katana favorite. While it was cooked to perfection, I just wasn't a fan of the seasoning. It taste good with the sauces, but the flavor profile by itself was not impressive.Fireminyon: Every bite of the bone in filet mignon was luxurious. The meat was juicy and tender, the flavor profile was amazing. Words cannot describe how delicious it was, you just have to try it for yourself. Rolls and nigiri:Shima: seared yellowtail with mango, jalapeno, and avocado was interesting. I feel that whenever you sear a fish, the texture of the roll changes. It was a little tough to chew, but it was an interesting flavor combination with the tart mango and creaminess of the avocado.Katana: a spicy tuna center, with tuna sashimi, jalapeno, with yuzu( citrus) oil was good. It had a subtle slow burn kind of spiciness to it. Dessert: Apparently no menu, but they had a decadent molten chocolate cake that was the perfect cap to a delicious meal and giant macaroons( but the server called it something else).",4.0,2,1,0

This dish was a party in my mouth.  The Eggplant wasn't overcooked so it was firm but tender.  I know that's hard to understand but all I can say is that it didn't have a mushy texture like a lot of Eggplant dishes tend to have when they've been cooked for too long.  But the part of the dish that takes it to the next level is the Bok Choy and the Teriyaki Sesami sauce.  That may not even be what it's called but the sweet flavor really gave this dish the kick it needed.  And couple it with a side of white rice and soy sauce you really have a great pairing of sweet and salty flavors.  I ordered the Sex and Violet for my cocktail and all I can say is in all my years of drinking and enjoying craft cocktails this one is by far my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE of them ALL!!!  I have never tasted every single ingredient in one drink before in my life.  I mean the flavors were perfectly blended together.  You could taste the Cucumber Bitters, I so with I lived in Chicago just so I could order one of these a day.  My life would be complete!",5.0,3,3,0

Unfortunately, they didn't have their full drink menu available at the time but our bartender Laura was very friendly and made us something based on our preference. This is a fine dining restaurant. Hence, expect relatively smaller portion sizes and a bit of a higher tab. But, if that's what you're into, it is most definitely worth it. We shared several dishes and I can't quite remember them all but there were two that still stand out clearly in my memory.The hamachi dice was recommended by several staff members to us and I am so glad we ordered it. It was so delicate but so flavorful. I would probably order that again if I came back.Next, the wagyu. This was my first time tasting wagyu and it was by far the most succulent, decadent, and luxurious piece of beef I have ever eaten. It was perfectly marbled, and although salt was offered on the side for a bit of seasoning, the quality of it was outstanding enough to hold its own. This waygu probably set the bar as the best beef/meat I have ever had. We also had the 40 day dry aged new york steak. While it was good, I think you could find a comparable steak elsewhere. It was also unfair having in the same meal as wagyu which far overshadowed it. If you're going to go for the new york steak, might as well go for another ounce of wagyu. This is a gorgeous place.

My only slight complaint was that the arugala and shaved parmesan was just slightly overpowering. Because I'm obsessed with truffle, we also ordered the truffle edamame. The Pringles jingle should be about this dish because once you popped, you couldn't stop! Now I'm not sure if this was a special or whether it is a regular feature, but they had crab cakes made from king crab (as opposed to jumbo lump). These were some of the best crab cakes we have had. The accompanying teriyaki sauce gave a great Asian flair to the dish. Also delicious were the wagyu beef and chilean sea bass skewers. We also tried the katana roll, which was good but nothing special vs other sushi places in the city.The service started off great but as the restaurant became busier, our service became slower.

And most special of all is the table attached to the sushi bar, where parties of three or four can enjoy a hybrid of conventional table seating and intimate interaction with the chef. It's a winning concept.The omakase is ""chef's choice"" but is individually tailored to your preferences and the number of courses you'd like. We chose ten courses and put ourselves in chef's hands for a very special experience.Our favorite courses were salmon rolled around fuji apple and topped with osetra caviar; ""smoked"" salmon that was actually fresh salmon topped with smoked trout roe and bourbon smoked sesame seeds; and raw scallop nigiri topped with osetra caviar.

The Big F$#%in Pretzel is named appropriately for its impressive size, served with a side of mustard & merkts cheese, and comes out so warm/soft.

I prefer a crispy batter so I probably would not order these again.Sliders were also a mixed bag. The ""Big Dave"" was the opposite of the pretzel and was pretty effin' tiny--but my favorite in terms of flavor. The waitress did warn us that the beef sliders were on the smaller side so keep that in mind if you're really hungry. The ""buffalo chx"" was my second choice and the sauce made all the difference. You couldn't taste the honey on the fried chx so it felt dry. The ""Kentucky hot brown"" was probably my least favorite--something about the cheddar mornay was a bit off putting.The atmosphere totally changed and went up a few notches around 9pm in terms of volume/crowd.

We ended up at Henry's after our hopes of getting into another establishment were dashed. I loved everything about the vibe - a super fun DJ that was playing some 2000s bangers, a menu with a self-aware sense of humor, and bartenders who didn't ignore me to take the order of someone taller and/or louder. I opted to Put a Bird On It and enjoy the so-named cocktail comprising bourbon, Malbec, lemon, and blood orange liqueur. It was strong but balanced and unlike any bourbon cocktail I've yet encountered - the tannin of the Malbec drew out a bitter quality that was different from the herbal bitterness you find in other drinks. On the flip side of my craft cocktail was the joy my boyfriend found in the offering of Old Style tallboys. Nothing fancy to see there, but it's his favorite lawnmower beer and it's nearly impossible to find at a bar in Madison.

Consistently great food, great service and reasonable pricing (admittedly not inexpensive, but I'm all for the price point and unlimited steak) - my 'home Fogo' is in Indianapolis but I like to try Fogo in other cities when I travel.  There is a lot of great food in Chicago, but I still ventured out to try their Fogo option.Fogo in Chicago has the usual - great salad/food bar with all sorts of goodies, several cuts of meat that come straight to your table, adequate wine list, and if you're in the mood some desserts that look good.

I didn't like the price tag of this experience but I wasn't paying so I still gave this four stars. If I had to pay for this, I may have given it a three star review. 50+dollars for a plate is a lot. Especially when I filled up on salad. There should be an option just to buy a salad buffet bar pass.",4.0,0,1,0

We were greeted by a wonderful friendly host who offered to check our coats and my bags. We were seated and quickly asked what type of water we wanted. After ordering a delicious bottle of wine, we hit he salad bar. If i were vegetarian, this would be a very satisfying salad buffet. After eating our tasty charcuterie and veggie items, we were provided clean plates to start the meat show. Top sirloin, bottom sirloin, chicken thigh, bacon covered chicken breast, lamb chops, pork and beef ribs and lamb chops. If something didn't come out, we were able to request it. My favorite was the top sirloin, you can ask for the rareness you like. So tender, salted perfectly and delicious! We were also given cheesy puffs, fried yuca, plantains and garlic buttered mash potatoes. But we know what we're here for right? Meat! I don't know but i feel like i had my money's worth.

I do not eat pork or lamb so unsure how those were but having tried all the beef options I can vouch for it's pure deliciousness.

There are about 10-11 different meat options.  The winners are easily the hanger steak with chimichurri sauce and the chargrilled buttermilk sirloin, which is marinated in buttermilk ranch for 48 hours.  They were both out of this world.  They had the perfect amount of char, were very well seasoned and the meat was unbelievably tender, which is saying a lot considering that these aren't the best cuts of meat.  The meat of the ribeye was surprisingly not as yummy as the sirloin or hanger steak but it was served with some caramelized onions that were phenomenal - tender and sweet.  I'd return for those alone.  The asian pork belly was good as well as was the tandoori chicken.  I would not recommend coming here for the seafood (I know you wouldn't).  The salmon was perfectly cooked but definitely lacked seasoning and the ahi tuna was just bad.  I'm not even sure what else to say about it.We were more than stuffed by the time we finished the meat portion of the Zed experience but because it was Valentine's Day we couldn't leave without getting dessert.  We ordered the maple bourbon banana pudding cake which was just okay.  It wasn't as moist as you'd expect it to be given that it's pudding cake.  Also, it's served with a white chocoloate mousse which I think was a big mistake.  My husband and I agreed that this cake defnitely would've benefitted from being an a la mode.  It needed both the moisture and the temperature contrast that ice cream couldve provided.All in all I'd say it was a solid experience at Zed from our awesome server (seriously - ask for Jenny, she's great and kept the night full of laughs) to the tender and flavorful steaks.  I thought pricing was very fair considering the amount of food you get for $53.90.",4.0,1,0,0

There was an extra cost for potatoes, and my husband was complaining about the lack of plantains. And those little cheesy bread rolls... While I really did enjoy the quality of the food, unless they start offering coupons, I'd probably opt to go to Fogo next time I want to go into a meat coma.  But I do recommend trying this place out and if others I know want to go for dinner, I will more than happily join them.",4.0,0,0,0
KlReEx1J8olxWzNMSZguyg,d6UbRb9W5eA1yL-DuVZ8ug,9rG5KC4OOOUyOmqAEtC8-g,2/4/2018,"Went to ZED451 last night. While I think their sirloin is nice, the general restaurant week isn't something I would recommend. If you do plan on going just for restaurant week, I would recommend their sirloin, obviously, and their black bean rice located south east corner of the fire pit lol it's a very very nice rice, each grain is soft, cooked evenly, good flavor too! Why do I like emphasize on their rice so much? Well here is why:There are 12 selection of meat if you pay full price which is $52 as we were told. The restaurant week experience is $33 with as little as 3 selections. So while we are paying 3/5 the price, we are not even getting 1/3 of the selection of meat. Secondly, everything was just so sweet... their salad is sweet, their cheese is sweet, their butter is sweet, their corn bread is sweet, their appetizer is sweet, their chicken is sweet, and their salmon is definitely the sweetest piece of candy I have ever tasted. While the salmon is cooked to the perfect tenderness, that flavor was just too much. It's like eating candy but meat. Their chicken has a good amount of sweetness as well but at least it has other flavor to somewhat balance it, just very dry tho. Which leaves the only edible meat their sirloin. That sweetness isn't umami sweet, or chinese bbq pork savory sweet. It's like rock candy sweet, which My friends and I are not a fan of. Which leaving sirloin the only meat that's edible but it's a very delicious sirloin. The interior is very cool, while the selection of salads and apps isn't as variety rich as other brazilian places, neither do they have any signs of cheese bread. The fire pit kind of made up for it by adding some intensity to that area. Service is also an element which I think their restaurant week deal isn't helping. For the first 30 minutes of our dining experience we were basically just in a stand by waiting phase. Then once we had our first round of meat we were yet again in another waiting phase. It's a bit unavoidable since you just see all the servers look at you and walk away because they are not allowed to serve you the meats since you only get 1/4 the selection with 2 not even edible dish. While I'm sure their full experience would be great, but I can only speak for what I experienced during restaurant week. All the other brazilian steakhouse is serving full menu tho, so there's something to think about if you are looking to dine all you can eat steak. Again, I just don't think their restaurant week is helping their reputation, if anything it's kind of hurting it a bit. It was just not very well thought out. You can't really invite people in just to make them feel left out. But their rice is really good lol it's kind of the best rice I've had in chicago honestly; they can open up a sister ricetaurant lol",3.0,2,1,0

Some of the meat can be tough and service is very inconsistent. You are likely to wait a long time to get the item you want again because of how they pace food out.

QFeJnQo60SojGHXBt02YNg,d6UbRb9W5eA1yL-DuVZ8ug,YEKj6XdpB2Y9szihe3NFrA,9/2/2017,"If you think Brazilian style steakhouses are all the same, you haven't met Zed451 yet. It's true, the format is similar: go up and get your cold salads from the ""Harvest Table,"" then go back to your seat and move the small stone off its dish to indicate that you want people to come to your table with an endless supply of meats.With Zed451, that experience is more refined. First off, the Harvest Table goodies are more than just bits of cheese, hearts of palm, etc. They've elevated it from a simple presentation of quality ingredients to a well orchestrated combination of ingredients and flavors in each dish. Be sure to try the POACHED APRICOTS IN VANILLA SPICED SYRUP and the PORT FIGS near the charcuterie section...heck, try a bit of everything. Make sure you try the excellent HOUSE CURED SALMON as well.The meats are similarly well thought out, with the BUTTERMILK BOTTOM SIRLOIN being one of our overall favorites. The CHIMICHURRI HANGAR STEAK has a wonderful rich flavor, and is another standout. With a traditional Brazilian steak house, the meats are only seasoned with salt, and they are delicious, but Zed451 has opened up the possibilities by spicing these items however they damn well please.I highly recommend the BRUNCH, which is both cheaper and more craveable, available until 2pm Saturday and Sunday.Believe it or not, one of my favorite dishes is the VANILLA SPICED STEEL-CUT OATMEAL. Also a must try at brunch is the DUCK CONFIT HASH BROWNS. They've reorganized a bit, so if you live for their MAPLE CAJUN BACON like I do, you can heap it on a plate to your heart's content because now they have it on the harvest bar, ready for you to grab as much or as little as you like. You'll still get a HUGE delicious cinnamon roll in a small cast iron skillet delivered to your table. There is a good selection of meats brought to the table during this time as well, including my favorite buttermilk bottom sirloin, hangar steak, LINGUICA SAUSAGE and a fantastic BUFFALO CHICKEN AND WAFFLE.For brunch, their dessert table has gone full-out Vegas style, with small portions of everything from CREME BRÛLÉE to MACAROONS to CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES. The macaroons were particularly good on our last visit, chewy and delicious.Brunch is a more special time than dinner in my opinion, because the variety and flavors are just kicked up a notch. It's also easy to get a table here during lunch, even if you don't have a reservation, so that's a plus. It's a great place for large parties...they're set up to easily accommodate parties of 12 or more.We've been coming to Zed451 for about 10 years now, and a few years ago their quality started going downhill. We hadn't been there for about two years, but when we went back we were pleasantly surprised that the quality is back up big time. I think it's better now than when we first started going there. And everyone from the hostess to the servers to the chefs are very friendly and attentive. It is definitely worth a stop.

Boy, was I in for a treat! This time around, I could tell that the staff truly valued me as a customer - just as they seemed to value every other guest in attendance for Sunday brunch. Our waitress, Jenny (""from the block""), was very friendly, exceeding our service expectations tenfold. For those of you who didn't see my previous review, the gist of it was that I was disappointed when our server did not acknowledge my significant other's birthday. To make up for it this time, Jenny brought out a special ""belated birthday"" treat. I also saw another couple being celebrated for an anniversary, so I now know that my previous experience was just a fluke and that they do indeed make special occasions feel even more special!On top of the ""belated birthday"" celebratory mini blueberry pies & homemade vanilla ice cream (yum!), Jenny, self-proclaimed ""alcohol whisperer"" took it upon herself to bring me a surprise adult bevvy. This drink was absolutely gorgeous (blush pink, my favorite color). It tasted divine, too. The name: ""Pinkies out."" Contents: Gin, rosé, lychee liqueur, and an egg-white froth. My boyfriend went more basic than me and ordered the mimosa; it was heavy on the champagne, and most would argue that's a good thing.As for the food, the concept is the same as at dinner (though personally, I liked brunch even better!). There are several buffet options to choose from, including charcuterie, salad, and dessert. They also had the best bacon I have ever had in my life. Seriously. Once you indicate that you're ready, the chefs come around with several selections of freshly prepared meats. Today's selections included catfish, buffalo chicken & waffles, and moroccan chicken, among others. Hands down my favorite was the buttermilk sirloin, about which the chef made a point to tell me that it marinates for 24 hours. Twenty four hours, people! Jenny made sure that this cut made it back to our table for seconds. Overall I had a wonderful experience at ZED451's Sunday brunch. Honestly, I went home so full that the BF was afraid I might puke (and if I had, it still would have been totally worth it). We will definitely be making our way back to ZED451, though our next stop will be the rooftop bar, which we have yet to experience. Until next time!  - Kaitlyn",5.0,0,0,0

I've been to many brazilian steakhouses and although this place isn't a brazillian steakhouse like fogo or texas de brazil, the concept is pretty similar in that they bring you the steak, cut it up for you and you eat it accompanied with the AYCE salad bar. The salad bar in comparison to texas de brazil was a bit disappointing. although the items seemed fancier and the display was cleaner and prettier, there was about half the items you would get at fogo or texas. No smoked salmon!:(the steak and entree however, was 10x better! most meats came with some special sauce (like chimichurri or caramelized onions) and had WAYY better seasoning than fogo. sometimes I feel like at fogo or brazil, I couldn't tell the difference between the tastes of the different cuts. Here, however, you can definitely tell what's what based on taste. The quality of the meat seemed slightly better as well- a bit more tender, better cooked. My favorite was the short rib and the pork belly! So good and melted in my mouth! My boyfriend took me here for my birthday and although we were too full to order dessert, they gave me a mini red velvet mouse cake with ""happy birthday"" written on the plate, which was very nice.",4.0,1,0,0

The hostess then took us to our table. The staff was nice and friendly and the service was pretty good. The interior is also very nice. When we sat down the the waiter came over and explained the process to us. The brunch was a buffet but they have rocks on the table that you take off of the plate that they were on to signal that you wanted staff with roasted meats on a skewer to come over and place meat on your plate. The brunch was pretty good. I do not have any real complaints. They had tons of things to pick from. Some of the items consisted of kale salad, slaw, potato salad, croissants with strawberry butter, frittata, potatoes wth duck meat and onions, french toast, oatmeal, cheese and meats, steaks, chicken, turkey, sausage, buffalo chicken & waffles, and etc. Most of the food was good.

I found the bartender to be very friendly and provided a couple of wine samples for me to try. She also called the sommelier over to answer some of my follow-up questions about the wines, which I thought was nice. I ended up having a glass of the Torres Ibericos Tempranillo Rioja.Since I was sitting at the bar, I decided to try one of their Bar Cravings which is their version of appetizers. I tried the buffalo chicken and waffles. They-were-delicious. It appears they bake the chicken and then flash fry it because it had a nice crispy coating. The meat was very moist and tender. It is probably one of the best servings of buffalo chicken I have ever had and the waffles were good also. The buffalo seasoning was not overpowering which was awesome. It was just the right balance of seasoning.The Rooftop, which is on the second floor, is nice. It is small but spacious and has patio couches and other seating throughout the area along with a standard bar and TVs.  When I was there the Cubs' game was showing on the TVs, but instead of the volume/sound of the baseball game, they had loud music playing. To me it was a bit of a turnoff. At any rate, I definitely recommend checking this place out. You may want to ease your way by trying the happy hour specials during the week.",4.0,1,0,0

First off, it offers a great deal in terms of the food available for the typically limited Restaurant Week menu. The space itself is stunning; all high ceilings, warm fireplaces, and soft chairs. Very nice.  We were seated immediately, probably due to the early hour. Despite the nice environment, there was a smell of old food lingering in the dining room. Normally I am not too worried about this, but on this day the smell was pretty overwhelming. It brings into question how well staff are cleaning, for me.Anyways, we ordered drinks, and began with the Harvest tables. The tables had charcuterie, salads, breads and spreads, and soups. Overall the tables had a good variety, except the soup table, which had some lemon chicken soup and a pot of rice. Not sure what they were thinking there. The bread was pretty average, but the spreads- including butter with truffles and honey chili butter was very good. The salad table was also good with several different choices of interesting salads. The drinks had come out by the time we got back from the tables. The drinks for the four of us were good, but nothing to write home about.Soon after, the meat began to come out. First the salmon- this was nicely done. A good glaze on top, it was well cooked- not overdone, but just right. Very tasty. Then the char grilled buttermilk sirloin came out. Oh boy, wow! Exceptional. Juicy and chargrilled goodness. Third out was the chicken. This had a nice set of spices on it, but was a little dry. In addition we had a chance to try the lamb. This was also on skewers. It was over cooked and a bit hard. In general, a mixed review on the meats we tried.The dessert was good. A chocolate flourless cake.

The service was incredibly slow with the rotation of meats. We asked for specific items, per the server because of the end of service, and never got them.  Drinks were slow to arrive.

Despite the usual assortment of wintry Chicago elements outside, the dining experience inside was well stocked with diners, most of whom were elegantly dressed to match the fine atmosphere indoors. Our server was very patient with us, as my dining companion and I chitchatted throughout the evening rather than selecting menu choices immediately. His dry expertise was very helpful with any food questions that we had. The waitstaff team provided impeccable service throughout. The live music in the adjacent room added to the overall experience. We were presented a bread basket, which held a good looking selection but was nearly untouched by us because we ordered a parade of food accompanied by adult beverages. My French onion soup was sumptuously hearty and gooey, while my galpal enjoyed her lobster bisque and her salmon main course. My entree was the 8 ounce filet, which was tasty as you would expect at a steakhouse. Our server mentioned that the side dishes were large and suitable for sharing. Indeed the Gorgonzola mac and cheese came out in a scintillating hot skillet, an enormous portion that could easily stand as an entree in its own right. We went with the Brussels sprouts as a second side, and they added a healthy kick to our meal. We were thisclose to not ordering dessert, but I blurted out an order of the profiteroles. We were not expecting such a beautiful presentation, but this sculpturally scrumptious dessert was a treat for the eyes and the taste buds. Three puff pastries were filled with ice cream and topped with drizzled chocolate sauce, powdered sugar, two chocolate sticks, and a generous dollop of whipped cream. As if that were not enough, they added a side tray of extra cream, though that was left untouched as the main body of dessert was substantial enough. This was a terrific ending to a fine meal at Mastro's.",4.0,16,14,9

We had to flag another waiter to send our steaks back. After waiting for the re-fire we ended up taking our food to go.

I don't often feel obligated to rate a business this lowly, but wow my first experience at Roy's for my partner's birthday was shockingly bad. From service, to drink prep, to food quality - it was a bad evening. First we sit down and finally order cocktails after a long wait at the table. 2 of the 3 in our first order show up incorrectly. My ""charred lemon sour with rosemary sprig & grilled lemon"" featured no rosemary or grilled lemon, leaving it a cup of whiskey with lemon juice. My friend's jalapeno margarita wasn't jalapeno. When he inquired about getting his drink fixed the rude man in a suit that kept leering over guests asked my friend ""are you sure you tasted it?"" and then rolled his eyes as he took back the $13 cocktail to get corrected. After seeing how he was treated I just left my incorrect drink on the table without inquiring, but I shouldn't have. The 2nd jalapeno margarita still had zero spice level. The man was actually intimidating enough that everyone at our table pointed out how weird it made us feel when he walked away.2. Price vs. food quality. When you're charging $40+ for some of your entrees, $20-30 for apps, and $10 for small plates of side items, your food better be DAMN good. Back that price up. In this case our table experienced lobster potstickers that tasted like a $3 bag frozen bag from Costco, 2 fish entrees from the tasting menu that were overcooked / slimy, a $45 4-fish combo entree that my friend best described as ""meh"",  and a flavorless lobster spring roll. If you're looking for asian food or seafood there are much better options around the city... hell I'd love to have paid 1/4 as much for a meal at PF Chang's that I know will be tasty. Intimidating service and fake fanciness (like interrupting our conversation to ask us to sit back in our seats so we could have our napkins placed in our laps?!?!) made this a ridiculous evening.

Bar bites and sushi are discounted a bit for this Happy Hour.We ordered a few things, listed in order from my favorite to least favorite.1. Szechuan Spiced Pork Ribs (Bar bite)You have to try these. So delicious. You get four ribs for 9.95 (usually 15). And they are some of the most delicious ribs I've ever had. Very soft, and gorgeous flavor. Not very spicy, mainly just a sweet sticky soy-based barbecue. 2. Wagyu Burger with Parmesan fries (Bar bite)$14.59 (usually 19). Pretty good burger. Large size with a fired egg on top. I liked this, but maybe won't order again. I asked for a medium, and It was a bit more well done than what I think is a medium. The burger was very juicy, but this made the bun soggy, which made it less appetizing to eat as it sat for a longer time. The parmesan fries, which just come with this, were a big disappointment. I really like crispy fries, and these are definitely soft, and not too much parmesan.3. Auntie Lei's Aloha Roll11.59 (normally 15). Spicy Tuna, Cucumber, Yellowtail, Salmon, Avocado, and Garlic Ponzu. A pretty good roll. I love this garlic ponzu sauce.Overall, I think this is a great way to try a lot of the Roy menu if you're ona budget. Not a very busy happy hour on a Friday afternoon, which is when I went.

Looked around noticed others were also waiting. I wanted something light and healthy, and I thought this being a place for fresh fish I could have a sushi roll and call it good. I ordered the sunrise roll (see photo), not realizing it was fried. I guess the word ""crunchy"" should have been my clue. It was gross. The coating was so thick I couldn't taste the fish, and the rice was gooey and flavorless.

The Omakase is definitely portioned out to be a full meal (served in a variety of pre-selected small plates) and left both of us stuffed with leftovers to take home.Favorites: - Yuzu Miso Marinated Black Cod was the MOST delicious dish. So buttery and savory and flaky!!! - Waygu is so tender and decadent. It's served in a smaller potion but it's a meat to be savored!  - Amberjack nigiri and the sashimi platter. Great variety and very fresh fish!  - Japanese whisky selection is quite expansive. The Yamazaki 18 year (~$50 per pour) is so smooth that even I liked it! Next favorites/runner-ups: - Scallops with gooseberries and butter sauce. This dish had great variety of textures and some different flavors with the gooseberries - Brussels Sprouts. I always love Brussels sprouts and this was no exception - Ribeye with Wafu sauce... while ribeye is definitely not my favorite cut of meat, the Wafu dressing is drinkable!!!  - Delicious birthday dessert with tons of variety and a nice/attentive move! Downsides: - The Omakase meal seemed low on sushi/sashimi/nigiri/steak dishes with too many veggies... Definitely could have done without the Roasted Best Salad, Asparagus and the LARGE rice dish that we both did not enjoy.  - Getting charged for edamame at the start - There were things I LOVED and then there were things that were ok, but I expect to LOVE everything when dropping over $200 per personI would come again and pick the dishes that we loved rather than going the Omakase route again. For Omakase in Chicago, I'll continue to head over to Kai Zan!",4.0,3,1,1

Everyone in the restaurant is watching the game while eating. Even the waiters would stop from time to time to have a quick glance lol. For the starters, we are served with Yellowtail Tataki and Unagi Maguro Maki. The Yellowtail is fresh and has tons of flavors. The Ponzu sauce is sweet and tangy, and goes perfectly well with the fish. The maki is a little disappointing though. The flavor of unagi is entirely overwhelmed by maguro on top. I wish there were more unagi or less maguro to keep the balance. We have Wagyu Sirloin and black cod for entree. The steak is just simply seasoned and is perfectly cooked to medium rare. It literally melts in my mouth. A fantastic way to present the Wagyu beef! The mushroom has a slightly lemony taste. It balances out the richness as well. I would recommend skipping the mayonnaise on the side though. The steak is already rich enough, adding the mayo may feel a bit greasy. The cod is as amazing as the steak. The fish is really delicate and cooked to perfection. You can taste a lot of flavors in the fish. It's sweet and tangy from yuzu, and savory from miso. Once again, the sauce is a bit unnecessary to my taste. The fish itself is flavorful enough. The dessert items are a bit let down. We have the Ube Pot De Crème and chocolate cake. The presentation of the two dishes are amazing -- beautiful as pictures. The chocolate cake is a great combination. Warm chocolate lava cake together with a tiny scoop of coffee ice cream. When having the first bite, I was blown away. I thought I finally found a chocolate cake that was not overly sweet. But the more bites I have, the sweeter it gets. And it finally gets intolerably sweet about half way into the cake. As for the Ube Pot De Crème, it's super sweet the first bite, and entirely throws off the balance. Wish the restaurant can tune down a sweetness a bit.Overall, 4 stars for the entrees. I may come again in the future, but will skip the appetizers and go straight to the entrees.",4.0,1,1,0

It was one of the best meals I had that year. When we arrived for our reservation, they brought us Champagne and oyster shooters on the house to get our experience started. The meal consisted of five courses chosen by the chef of all of their high end products from Toro to A5 grade Waygu Beef. Every course was an amazing work of art that was worthy of a front cover of Food and Wine magazine. Not knowing what the courses were going to be,  we asked the sommelier to match every course. The wine and food pairings were amzing and three hours later we left with a very memorable  experience and extremely  happy palettes.      I have  a habit of not letting experiences like that be ruined by going back. Historically I am always dissapointed with my next trip so I never went back.... till tonight.       First of all, as a single diner, I was treated just as well as an eight top. My server Nick was very knowledgeable of the menu and pleasant to be with. The management was also very friendly, knowledgeable and professional.         Let's talk food. I had the Premium Sashimi platter which was amazing. The highlight was the Blue Fin Tuna ""flight"" that included  Akami, Chu-Toro, and OToro. Then, to my surpise, they added Nigiri on the side (I missed that after I read premium Sashimi  They they were too beautiful to eat (for about five seconds). They were so good I asked Nick to get me two more and surprise me. He brought Toro Tar Tar and a Spot Prawn with Uni. I could have eaten a whole plate of just those and left happy. To make everything even better I orders a glass of Kubota Neldju Cold Sake which paired amazingly well.       I have no more fear that the first visit was a fluke. $140 later I knew I would come back, but next time with my wife.",5.0,1,0,0

There is supposedly a Nobu opening up next year along with its own hotel, but I'll believe it when I see it. In any case, we saw the reviews and A5 on the menu at Roka Akor in Chicago and had to try it for our anniversary.We requested and was sat at a booth near the wine cellar, so that was fine. We did have one snafu with the busser when we arrived - when asking if we wanted bottled or tap, we asked what was on bottle. He told us Acqua Panna (my favorite bottled water) so we agreed. But instead he brought out San Benedetto which I didn't like. And at $8 per bottle, seemed very mediocre. I don't recommend this water.Anyway, onto the food! Our server was very nice and made note to take into consideration some of our food restrictions. We ordered off the menu and did not do an Omakase or tasting menu because we are a bit picky with what we like/don't like. The meal came with a tofu amuse bouche that was good. Our favorite starters were the Beef Tataki, Escolar Tataki, Yellowtail, and Toro Tatare. AMAZING. We did not care for the Madai Crudo or the Wagyu Gunkan.The main entrees we had were the skirt steak with truffle aioli and add on bone marrow and the A5 ribeye. These dishes were soooooo good.

My wife went for the smallest steak cooked medium while I had a great strip steak in the rare-midrare range. Both steaks were cooked perfectly, so nice to have a steak just the way you want it done. The side almost stole the show, risotto with mushrooms and some asparagus with béarnaise sauce. I appreciated having the sauce on the side, a little goes a long way.

It's a River North Steakhouse without the River North Steakhouse pricing. Almost every cut of meat is under $50, and we're talking pretty similar steak as such places like Gene and Georgetti, or the Chicago Chop House. If you're not doing steak, I have to suggest their meatloaf sandwich. So moist it melts in your mouth and served with a beef gravy that will leave you licking the plate clean. At about $14 it's even more of a bargain than the steak and to get a meal like it across from the Merch Mart is definitely a find. Classic in ambiance and you always have service a smile.

But he did enjoy it immensely, as I did my Tiramisu.Bread was great, though I said ""no"" to a second basket when offered (before the entrees were brought out).  The complimentary procecco  (just enough for a toast) was very nice, so I ordered 2 more glasses during my meal.  The cappuccino was also perfect.All-in-all, a great place to which we will return soon (just won't have to worry about over-ordering).  We were half-tempted to stop for sushi a half-block south, though it was a long evening and mom was ready for us to pick her up and go home.",5.0,1,2,2

We came to celebrate Valentine's Day, and unfortunately it was the worst dinner ever!!! Let's start from the beginning, we came on time and everything was ok, we got a table and decided to order drinks, I ordered wine and my husband ordered beer. Our server didn't know how to pour beer correctly so it was all over the table. Then we ordered an appetizers, I let me server know that I'm pescetarian and I don't eat meat. I asked him if the clams appetizer has any meat, he said ""no"", so I ordered it. After we got our appetizers and I started eating it, I realized that something there looks like pieces of sausages, I asked my server again if it's meat, he said: ""absolutely not! It's clams or fish"" I was like okay, thanks. And I gave it to try to my husband, he said that it is meat!!!! So I told my server once again, he said: ""ok, I'm sorry about that, it's gonna be on a house"". Are you guys serious? First of all, what if had an allergy? I could die because your server doesn't know what ingredients are in every dish!? Secondly, not eating meat, is my lifestyle, my choice and it's very important to me! First time in 3 years since I became pescetarian, Prosecco restaurant (""high level restaurant "") forced me to eat that meat! Your apologies are nothing. I was about to start crying. It was a couple seated near us, and they got there pasta with pieces of chicken, but on the menu it was only salmon. They were vegetarian too, so they  weren't  happy as well. But anyway we ordered 2 pastas, one vegetarian for me, another one with shrimps for my husband. Another server (turned out that she was a co-owner  of the restaurant) brought us 2 pastas, and one was  with meat, instead of the one with ordered with shrimps!!!!! So we explained it to her again, she said that she is sorry and she touched me by the shoulder at least 5 times like I'm her friend or something. Lady, don't touch people in any way! I'm not your friend and I don't like it! That's my intimate personal space! Do you know what's that!?! So in the end, she brought us one more pasta with shrimps and told us that the third pasta is on a house... The rule of the Valentine's Day was 75$ minimum charge per person, which is a lot!! You can't spend 75$, seriously for real it's a lot to spend, their prices are not so high, you could die of the food coma! And especially if you are not drinking, so that stupid. You guys are saying that you are high level restaurant, and you are asking for minimum charge? Lol. If your costumers will like what you do they will spend even more.... hold on, it's not the end of the story. We got our check, and they took my clams appetizer out of the bill, but in the end of the check they added it again!!!! Can you imagine??? I was sooooo mad, so I was asking our server to come to our table again, I was like what's wrong with you guys??? And it was 22% tip included!! Do you really think that's normal!?!? 22% tips are for really high level of service, your service worth 0%, in any fast food they serve you better then at your ""restaurant "". And then..... their fancy chief (second co-owner) came to our table and started screaming on us, tore a check from my hand and started his loud show: ""I'm so tired of you, relax, everything is on a house! We are very busy today. And  you ruined everyone's Valentine's Day and bla bla bla"".  excuse me sir, don't you think you ruined our dinner????? And do you really think that I care if you are busy or not? It's none of my business! It's so unprofessional to explain why you messed up, I don't want to hear your excuses, because I DO NOT CARE!!!!! I came to relax, to pay 150$ plus tax and plus 22% tips and not to solve your problems! In the end their manager came to our table, and he was the only one polite and professional there.

The dining area on the left is much more romantic-looking with a cluster of candlelit tables and holiday decorations while the area on the right is catered more towards groups with a bar and large tables. The right side did have some candlelit small booths though. We were seated on the right side at a small round booth.APPETIZER- Cauliflower Arrosto: Roasted cauliflower with Calabrian chili, lemons, capers, and herbs. It was spicy and savory with a hint of tartness. It's not a must-order dish, but it was still good.ENTRÉE- Paccheri Frutti di Mare entrée: Tubular pasta, mussels, clams, shrimp, calamari, bay scallops, garlic, and tomato. I love that they brought out the entrée already separated into two plates for us. This dish tasted okay overall. However, the mussel I ate was undercooked and caused me to spit it back out, which I'm sure contributed to my friend's loss of appetite. The pasta was pretty starchy.DESSERT- Budino di Cioccolato: Dark chocolate mousse, extra virgin olive oil, sea salt, white chocolate shavings, and fiori di latte (cheese). It's essentially chocolate pudding. I maneuvered around the fiori di latte to get the dark chocolate mousse and white chocolate shavings. It was good, but I could only handle a couple of bites before it became too sweet for me.The service was fantastic. Our server kept checking to see if we were okay. They even provided a candle and wrote ""Happy Birthday"" on the plate in chocolate for us!Happy hour is 4:00pm - 7:00pm with drinks and food specials, but we just ordered off the regular menu.I would say it's more 3.5-stars rating, but I rounded up because the customer service really was exceptional.",4.0,3,4,1

I already felt bad that we were late but the waiters were very kind and moved us to a bigger table.

The highlight here is the wide variety of house-made pasta. We started by sharing a special ravioli stuffed with cheese and served in a mushroom truffle sauce. It was excellent, the highlight of our meal. Roasted cauliflower was a good, spicy dish that would work better as a side than a starter. Another good starter is the meatballs, which are large and savory. An appetizer portion is plenty, or you can have them on pasta as an entree.The Caesar salad was traditional and good.As an entree I had the Shrimp Fra Diavolo, which was not as spicy as some versions I've had. The shrimp had too much of a saffron flavor for my taste, but that's just me. The pasta was squid ink infused, heavier than typical spaghetti, and appropriately al dente.There's a decent wine list with a nice selection of Italian reds, perhaps priced a bit better than other Chicago lists.Service was pleasant and efficient, even though the place was full.

I have taste better lobster bisque soup from a grocery store soup stand. Also, it had 0 pieces of lobster, just an FYI. For my main course, I ordered the Chicken and Doughnuts. The doughnuts were served hot, which is a plus, however, that's where it stops. They were very large and everything on the plate lacked flavor.

My first piece of advice is always make a reservation! This place is always packed and impossible to walk in without a reservation on a weekend night. With that being said, I will not be back here anytime soon. The staff was not very friendly throughout our entire dining experience and seemed to be overworked. Our waiter was stressed and rarely visited our table. After waiting over 30 minutes, I finally had to go up to another waiter to ask if our table could just see a dessert menu. The venue gives off an east coast vibe. The restaurant reduces waste by using fans and open windows to cool down the customers rather then air conditioning in the summer. It definitely gives off an east coast vacation vibe. We ordered the King Crab dip for our appetizer at this venue and it did not disappoint. I had the fish tacos for my entree and they were flavorful, but nothing out of this world. Someone at the table got the lobster roll which was flavorful and a great portion size. Another person got the Seafood Pot pie and it was phenomenal! It was a creative dish and extremely well done.

The Hampton Social is a beautiful nautical themed restaurant that is famed for good reasons, the much instagrammed ""Rose all day"" sign tempted me to hop onto the bandwagon and take a photo or TEN there; the cool restaurant where each corner has different shade of lighting to satisfy different people as well as a different setup; an absolutely gorgeous and comfy lounge corner that encourages to be a couch potato; and most important of all, great food to complement all these! Our first visit here is during restaurant week, so we got to try more food for less bucks, AWESOME! The menu is a combination of the regular items which is important, because these are the kitchen's specialties, allowing you to actually experience the restauant's food and menu. TIP: check-in on yelp to receive a $16 fried calamari, which is absolutely deliiicious!!! We started out with a seafood chowder which was pretty generous in portion, creamy and you can taste the sea. Good start.Our entree were fish taco and chicken club, both looks phenomenal, with great presentation and a beautiful mix colors on the white plate. The fish in the tacos were three big pieces of fish, but unfortunately it was a bit dry and over seasoned for our taste. It probably is normal, as the fish has a strong flavor to it and requires that extra seasoning, and has a tougher  flesh. Thus, we can only say it is not quite our cup of tea, prefer something lighter and ore tender. The chicken in the club was crispy and the bread was soft and paired really well with the chicken as well as a house mayo sauce. This chicken club was a joy to eat, and it comes with fresh greens on the side.To finish off, we had bluemoon ice cream and a on the house birthday cake. The birthday cake is a selection of any available cakes and the birthday girl chose the carrot cake. The carrot cake was the best of the day. It was balanced, light and rich in flavor. Great way to end the meal!Overall, this is a great restaurant with great service and awesome ambience! The food is by no means shabby at all, but really enjoyable.

Staff was awesome and the seafood bites we had were very good.Fast forward to yesterday, me and a friend came for Restaurant Week brunch and the place still was easy on the eyes and was packed with many people getting the brunch fix. I started out with the New England Clam Chowder and it was some of the best I've had in a restaurant...very  nice portion. I then went with the fried chicken and donut which was decent and a good mix of sweet and savory. It came with a rose' glaze, maple syrup and honey lime butter...pretty good and very filling. The meal was capped off with lemonade cake and a side of peppermint stick ice cream. I enjoyed the cake, but I dont think my taste buds were not prepared for the peppermint ice cream.The drinks here are pretty good as they have a few rose' drinks on the menu hence the Rose' All Day thing going on here lol. I had a couple of the Frose' All Day cocktails which included rose', Titos Vodka and peach puree...quite refreshing and can do it to you if you have 2-3 and drink the fast enough.

The appetizer we ordered was light and refreshing. A few of us were vegetarians so they munched on the celery and carrots. A couple of us ate the spread (I think maybe it had crab in it). The drink I had was the sunset beach, which was made with tequila, prickly pear cactus, lemon, and whatever demarara is. I'm sure I asked at the time, but now I can't remember. I like the drink options here because there are a lot of sweeter drinks (I basically only have alcohol if it's sweet). A few friends had frosé, but the frosé machine was partially broken (it wasn't freezing everything the way it was supposed to); they still enjoyed their drinks, though!

We had reservations for lunch for a party of two on a Wednesday. We checked in a few minutes early, but didn't get seated for another 20 minutes. We were seated in a booth in the bar area. There was dark wooden decor and intimate lighting all around. It took a while for our polite server to come to our table after giving us the menus and we were ready to order as soon as he finally came back. We started with blue fin tuna tartar and the pear & walnut salad. Great presentation and great taste. I could've used a few more pieces of bread for the tartar though.  The bus boys cleared our tables quick and we expected our main entrees to follow shortly. As we waited, we watched our server and other gentlemen in suits keep busy with some restocking activities. It seemed like they were setting up for dinner while the place was still full with the lunch crowd. Our wood grilled steaks were cooked perfectly and tasted great. We finished up rather quickly and again our table was cleared, but our desserts did not come out as quickly as expected. In looking around, others were waiting for service as well and you can see the frustration on several faces as they looked at their watches. In many higher end restaurants we've dined at, a host or manager would come and ask how things are doing. To our surprise, not one person came to talk to us even while they knew we were sitting there with no food on the table. We waited quite a while again for our dessert and we actually had to flag down our server to ask for our check so we wouldn't have to wait too long again. Our apple pie sundaes were delish, but the ice cream was already melted by the time we got them.The entire experience took nearly 2 hours, which isn't truly ideal since we were on our lunch break from work.

It's Restaurant Week and we make it a tradition to go to RPM Steak every year (3 course meal for $22). We made a reservation a few days ago for 7 people without issue, and even moved back our reservation time today when a meeting interrupted our plans. The staff at RPM Steak were very accommodating about our change and had our table waiting when we walked in at 1pm.The waiter immediately provided menus, poured glasses of water, and asked if we wanted anything else to drink. We placed our drinks order and perused the Restaurant Week menu and saw the following options:Starters: Pear & Walnut Salad, Butternut Squash Veloute, and Blue Fin Tuna TartarMains: Grilled Mediterranean Chicken, Striped Bass Oreganata, and Wood Grilled Bavette SteakDessert: Apple Pie Sundae and Winter Citrus GranitaI opted for the Butternut Squash Veloute, the Mediterranean Chicken, and the Apple Pie Sundae. The Butternut Squash Veloute arrived in a bowl with curry yogurt and crispy bacon garnished with an apple chip and then the waiter poured the butternut squash soup over the top. It was cool to watch and tasted even better! The butternut squash was flavorful and the bacon and curry yogurt were a great change of texture and flavor. I love bacon and could have used a little more. As for the apple chip, I didn't quite like it. It was a really thinly sliced apple piece with the skin. Overall this was a good starter and perfect for such a cold day.My main course arrived and it looked great. It was grilled chicken on a skewer laying on a bed of orzo with tomato and onions with a garlic sauce on the side. The chicken was nothing special. It was succulent and tender but didn't have much flavor. The orzo was definitely the best part and I could have eaten five servings of it. It was perfectly cooked and the veggies were a nice touch. Paired with the chicken it was pretty good. As for the garlic dipping sauce, it was very fragrant. I had no idea how fragrant it was on the first bite and it definitely made me cough. But in moderation it was good with chicken. Dessert arrived and it looked good. The ice cream appeared to be vanilla ice cream however it definitely had a cinnamon kick to it. Lots of cinnamon. Four hours later I can still taste cinnamon. The salted pecan streusel was a good touch and added a bit of crunch to the ice cream however the apple was lost on me. Not bad, just not what I was expecting. In fact, if it wasn't for the tiny apple topping this wouldn't be an Apple Pie Sundae at all and rather a bowl of ice cream with pecan streusel on top. It was still good. Overall the service was excellent. No complaints about that. Definitely 5 stars! The food was good too and for $22 the Restaurant Week menu was definitely worth it. The chicken could have been a little better as it was nothing special but I can't knock it otherwise. I'd give the food 4 stars. RPM Steak does steak and seafood really well. If I came here on a Friday night for a steak it would be excellent along with the service. That said, I'm giving this place 5 stars.

I have heard such great things and read all the great reviews from other folks, but (this may be an unpopular opinion however) I expected more from my dinner. It wasn't 5 star worthy at all. My husband and I went on Sunday night for Restaurant Week. I noticed that none of the items on the RS menu were on their regular menu. I would have hoped to try items on the normal menu. But I get that it's seasonal. For the first course, my husband ordered the bone marrow and I ordered the squid. Both were okay. For our main course, we both ordered the Bavette. The steak tasted good but again, I expected more. It wasn't the best steak I have ever tried. And for our last course we ordered one of each of the available desserts, an apple pie sundae and a citrus icee dish. The serving sizes were very small and the main course had no sides. Glad our server mentioned this last minute so we ordered the cheddar biscuits and the onion rings. I found the cheddar business to be a bit dry and almost burnt. The onion rings were very good! My husband ordered a couple cocktails; the first, sixty-six parallel, looked beautiful but my husband was thrown off with the floating bits of dried strawberry in there.

RPM Steak is a huge space and right away I expected to be forgotten along with my company. The service was decent, from walking in the door and checking my coat, to the food making it to the table in a timely manner. The only thing I noticed was the fact that drink orders took longer than expected.We dined on Mediterranean octopus, truffle risotto (the featured side for the evening), Crispy Brussels sprouts, ""The Duke"" pre-cut ribeye filet, and Grilled lamb chops (a House Specialty). Starting with the octopus, I enjoyed the grilled flavors. I did feel like it was a little soft, and I wished there was more crispiness on the outside. I understand it can be hard to properly grill octopus. Grill it too much and it becomes like rubber. I think I would have been happier had it been overcooked a little.""The Duke"" came out and it was a little lean for what I have come to expect out of a ribeye. Still tasty, I would have preferred more seasonings. The rest of everything we ate easily overpowered the flavor of ""The Duke."" For those who eat one item at a time off of their plate, eating this separate might have been a good idea. Only then would anyone be able to appreciate the subtle delicious flavors this tiny order of meat delivered.A huge production was made for serving the risotto. Our waiter had our entire order. Then there was one guy who carefully set down a plate of risotto, then in his other hand, a tray of truffles sat, along with a small utensil for shaving slivers of truffle onto the top of the risotto. Watching this man distribute the shavings seemed like overkill. A nice gesture, and I may have missed the point, but I think a light sauteing of the truffles would have brought out more of the flavors of the fungi, pairing closer to the pungent cheesiness of the risotto. Otherwise I really couldn't taste anything but the cheese. The Crispy Brussels Sprouts were absolutely fabulous, generously buttered, crispy, and thoughtfully seasoned. I didn't ask, but I could have sworn there were little bits of berries and bacon. Divine! I would definitely make this one of my go-to sides for every visit.The older I get, the less I want a side of beef, and I opt for the unique flavor profile of lamb. I've noticed very few places will mess up lamb chops, where you can go to any steak restaurant and the beef can be overcooked or not seasoned well. I have to say, the lamb chops are a must when you eat here. All of the portions seemed small, but I got 4 perfectly-sized lamb chops and it took everything I had to not pick up that bone and chew the rest of the meat off of it! Just enough bone and fat flavored the meat and kept it juicy. I was in heaven!Perhaps there is some kind of method to the smaller-portion madness of meats which you can encounter with RPM. At the end of our meal, I had enough room for dessert (I shared my lamb chops), and I went for the baked Alaska. I thought the risotto was a production. Again with two people, the items were brought out to serve, and basically the dessert is covered with some kind of booze, set on fire, and extinguished with chocolate syrup. My male companion is not into desserts, but both of us relished in this charred delicacy of salted caramel, vanilla ice cream, and warm chocolate sauce.  I would consider coming here again, but it wouldn't be on the top of my list. Everyone here is friendly, and I did not feel uncomfortable for how I was dressed. I had to rush straight from work (business casual) and managed to throw on eye makeup in the Uber on the way down. To my surprise, I saw people dressed formally and casually, but not sloppy. This is a great spot for tourists, but I think I would pass for a spot more low key and with affordable parking.",4.0,7,7,4

The ribeye was an off menu item of the day since they don't have it all the time. All tasted amazing! Personally I prefer the snow beef as it literally melts in your mouth, but my Fiancé prefers the aged ribeye as it's more flavorful.

First off the waiter was not attentive at all. It really pained me to tip him more than 15%. So due to the bad experience with the waiter, it's going to be tough to give this a good review.Appetizers we got the Bacon. Standard for a steakhouse. Love that maple thick cut bacon. The bacon was delicious but I wish there were consistencies in the two pieces we got. One was clearly bigger than the other. For a high end restaurant like RPM steak thought it was really unprofessional to give us two pieces of bacon clearly of different size. Got the RPM Caesar salad. And for my entree I got the cowboy steak. Wow the cowboy steak was huge. You can tell it was a good cut. However, how come some people get their steak pre cut by the kitchen? I never was given that option or saw that option. Still, the cowboy steak was good. I highly recommend it. Also got the mushroom mac and cheese as a side and I thought it was whatever. For drinks I got the old fashion which was great, also got a drink that was similar to a sazerac. Believe it was the Brooklyn. Cocktails are solid here. Pricey but very solid.Now the waiter by no means was rude mean or unprofessional. He seemed to be a really nice guy, but he was just either really busy or more focused on giving his attention to the other tables he was waiting. It took me over 10 minutes to get 2nd drink. And it was my birthday. My date clearly told them it was my birthday. We got the check, we were thinking oh maybe a complimentary dessert will come our way. But at the end he said ""oh wait it's your birthday"" after we got the check and came out with some cotton candy. Yup cotton candy. Again, he was probably just really busy but you don't pay a $300 tab between 2 people to get that kind of service which lacks attentiveness and respect. Won't be coming back.

Totally understand however while we stood out talking to each other trying to figure out where we should head next I noticed that people who had no reservations were showing their id and waking in . On enquiring about this the guy at the door who was extremely uncultured started shouting and said extremely rude things which I was taken a back with.

We arrived to a fairly empty spot and we picked a seat by the dart boards.We sat down and were given menus when immediately a waitress came by for our drink orders. Since we just sat down, we asked for some time. After a few minutes she checks on us. A friend asked about the happy hour specials and she didn't know, reading her list and then handing it to us. My friends opt for $5 wine special and I got the pea shot matcha.After looking at the menus for snacks, we each three discovered we had a different menu. A waiter stopped by to check on us and we asked which menu was correct. He helped sort it out, but it seems like the ones they had sitting around were different. Staff was quickly trying to remedy this. How is it that there are so many versions for such a new restaurant?Our waitress was eyeing the situation the entire time and looked very annoyed that another staff helped us. We placed our order (burrata and crostini) and was then informed that the crostini wasn't available. We opted for the corn dogs instead. The food comes relatively quickly, way before our drinks. We waited for a bit and started to play darts. Finally, the drinks come. The wine glass my friend received had a lipstick stain.... My cocktail was okay, bit bland. As for the food, we enjoyed the corn dogs and burrata. The bacon jam with the burrata was a winner! It didn't come with much bread, 4 pieces, for the amount of cheese and jam. We ended up finding someone for more as our waitress couldn't have been bothered all evening.As we were wrapping up, we asked for the check and found the bill to be off, none of the small plates were half off per happy hour specials. They also charged for the extra bread.... I walked to the waitress about the happy hour prices and she was convinced it was right as her manager did it. Math doesn't add up, I point out and she finds him. The manager apologizes and we get a correct bill and are off.Definite miss in service. Our waitress clearly didn't want to be there.

It's a convenient location & the wait was only about 10 minutes so aside from many attractive patrons I don't see an incentive to return.

The small side of coleslaw had a vinegary tang that left me wanting more :)My friend chose the Chicago chilled lobster which was very similar to mine with lots of lobster, thick bread, and warm garlic butter, except his sandwich was spicier due to Sriracha Mayo and spicy giardiniera.Both versions were rich and decadent, and with the addition of a side of lobster Mac & Cheese, this was a treat for the books. The side order of lobster Mac n cheese was very small (a to-go pint) and didn't contain much lobster.  The price was $43 for 2 sandwiches and a side portion of lobster Mac 'n Cheese, and I feel that is very steep, which is why I won't be back, but this was a good start to my LR journey.There is also a Food Truck wandering around the city somewhere :)",3.0,2,9,6

My boyfriend and I are huge lobster fans and we wanted to try everything. I made an attempt to talk to the manager about the restaurant since my boyfriend informed me they were featured on TV, but the manager seemed very disinterested in small talk, telling us about their TV features, or talking about the food itself. Maybe they feel like they don't need to up-sell the customer service anymore? Otherwise, he seemed very hardworking so I'll chalk it up to a lack of charisma.Between my boyfriend and I, we tried the following:-Lobster Roll $16 + Extra Meat $8 - Traditional style-Lobster Mac and Cheese $10-New England Clam Chowda $6The lobster roll was the most impressive item we had, it had plenty of meat (because we ordered extra), and the flavors were strong, but I feel like it was missing just a tad of something from the Boston lobster rolls I'd had days ago. The meat was fresh but didn't taste quite as fresh as a true New England lobster roll (perhaps a given), but maybe my hopes were just too high. The roll itself was a bit dry and it didn't leave my mouth watering like New England lobster rolls do. The lobster mac and cheese was creamy but seemed canned and not particularly fantastic; it had a few pieces of lobster but was also topped with a heavy amount of Old Bay seasoning - not sure about the decision to go this route because I think the Old Bay actually ruins the dish.Lastly, don't order the clam ""chowda"". For one, it is not a true chowder but instead a broth like soup. Secondly, it was pretty bland. Lackluster, disappointing, and certainly nothing New England about it.Overall, I'd probably only come back if I were really, really craving a lobster roll and I somehow couldn't get a hold of a real one for a long time.

I too am a lobster roll connoisseur I order them wherever I go. Since we are landlocked here in Cincy we don't have many great ones, so when I'm traveling I take every opportunity to snatch one up. Not sure who's idea it was to cater LOBSTER ROLLS for our team lunch this year while in CHI town, but I want to award them the highest of fives! The main issues you run into with lobster rolls are: quality, and bun issues. This was the highest of quality and not overly tossed (I hate that!) the meat was still chunky and the acid level was spot on. The bun was SO PERFECT! It was a true home made split top in butter grilled. With so much butter that you could smell it and then when you tasted it butter oozed out of the perfectly crisp bun. But my favorite part of all? That they were delivered nicely, still in tact and presented thoughtfully. For some reason some caterers just don't care once they get your money and stuff gets sloppily thrown together.

Just simple, tasty lobster that really shines. It was excellent and I sincerely wish I had another one right now as I write this! Our order was a take out option and prepared in bulk along side a tasty but simple salad of greens topped with chick peas, feta, and heart of palm. The salad was also great and it reminded me how much I love heart of palm on a salad. Even prepared en masse and transported to an office building these rolls were fantastic. One super tiny critique on the take out option: I just wish they had provided larger serving utensils for the salad. It was definitely hard to plate it using the little forks we had.

Certainly better than swiss miss but the flavor profile want as robust as others i have had in recent years - not bad for a taste but I'm not likely to order it again. On to the soup. When this arrived I was super excited. A good sized bowl full of a greenish broth topped with greens. I swirled it around and could see big peices of pork carnita in it. That meat was tender and flavorful.  There was also some chopped up corn masa dumplings. As somebody who is gluten free any 'pasta-like' soup addition is majorly exciting.  Unfortunately, these tasted like plastic and the consistency was a bit too dense.

There was no taste other than salt...lots and lots and lots of salt. I poured a whole glass of water into my soup just so I could swallow it. There were chunks of pork in the soup, but the soup itself had zero pork flavor. In fact the salt was so overwhelming, I could not taste anything else - not the pork or avacado or chile or arugula...nothing but pure brine.

At around 6 on black Friday. It was busy but I think we had just beat the crowds since we were able to get seated within 10 minutes. The ordering system is a bit interesting, but you basically get assigned a table number, and you order at the counter, telling them your number. Then you get seated at that table. We ordered the chicken tinga tacos and the pork tacos. We also ordered a side salad, but I think they might have mixed us up with another table because instead of the side salad, we got the pumpkin seed dip.We hadn't ordered the dip, but they let us keep it, and it was really good! It's almost like a hummus, but has a different flavor that I can't really describe. The chips were a little salty, but the jicama and cucumbers were both really fresh and tasted great dipped in the dip. The chicken tacos were really flavorful and well cooked. The avocado added a nice creaminess, and the salsa on the side provided a nice kick. The pork tacos, on the other hand, weren't as saucy as the chicken, but the pork was so so so tender! The salsa verde that comes with it gives it just enough flavor to prevent from being bland. I really like the pork ones because they weren't drenched in sauce to make you feel unhealthy.The salad we had ordered wasn't coming but when we asked about it, they actually brought it out. Again, I think they might have messed up and given the dip to the wrong table, but it was nice that they let us keep it and still gave us the salad. The salad was pretty bad though, in my opinion; the dressing was just off for me -- too vinegar-y I think.Overall, Xoco has a lot of hype because of it's celebrity owner.

Here, you can also pay an additional $10 for bottomless bloodies. Unlike some of the other Four Corners restaurants, this place features a strong sports bar vibe. There are TVs everywhere, and you use trays instead of plates. Much to my delight, the buffet had some sports bar favorites (ie. chicken wings, mac & cheese bites, etc), and of course, there was the famed donut wall. Ideal for an Instagram photo op.  Fremont will always have the #1 spot in my heart, BUT Highline, SteakBar, Benchmark, etc. are tied for a close second :)",5.0,2,2,2
R1qc-U2NESdUgIJuDH7X8g,fEKUE_hIzur3XoHAzGOcvg,nLubA27Qo3EgTnIEOgVvbQ,12/3/2017,"Update to review (Jan. 29, 2018) - there were cup sleeves for the coffee cups, which was great as that coffee was hot and good.  Shout out to our  server Ann with the great tats was amazing.  Very friendly and great to chat with.  There was another woman there, long blonde hair...she was not our server but she stopped by our table to see if we needed drinks.************************************************Not gonna lie, me and  The Heiress Apparent (La J) simply came here because of the donut wall.  No idea what the brunch was going to be like,  Well we got our donut wall and a whole lot more.This place is going to become our new brunch place:  street parking, smoked brisket, sliders, donut wall, waffle bar and bottomless mimosas with a lot of different juices and syrups.  Brunch is $30, plus $20 for the bottomless mimosas.Nice thing about this place is that they take reservations, but only for parties of 4 and up.  La J and I walked in and were greeted by two different people.  The gentleman asked if we had a reservation, we said no, but they sat us right away at a two top table.  Our waitress came over to take our drink over, then a second one came over to make sure that we had been taken care of (believe she was a hostess).  For the juice bar, they had these small glasses (4 oz),  but our waitress was very nice and brought La J a larger glass for her juice.Once we got settled with drinks, we hit the buffet.  This is the first buffet I have been to that has metal trays instead of plates and I love it.  There was a paper liner on the tray and the size is great as you can really pile things on :-)So let's break down the stations:Drinks: at the front was a do it yourself Bloody Mary bar with a shitload of stuff to top your drink off.  Some of the customers got very creative and were literally walking around with a meal on top of their drink (sliders, a slice of pizza, boneless chicken wings, egg rolls, etc).  The bottomless mimosas was set up where the waitress comes over to the table and pours the champagne and you add the juice from the juice bar.  For parties of 4 or more, I saw the waitress simply left the bottle at the table for them.  Not having a bottle was not an issue as the waitress kept walking by to make sure my glass was full.The selection of juices and syrups were great.  I fell in love with a pineapple juice/strawberry juice mimosa and that alone makes this brunch awesome for me. La J got into the mix as well, mixing orange juice with the strawberry, candied peach and watermelon syrups.Food station: there was waffle and regular fries, sauteed broccoli, smoked brisket, pork belly, some other carved me (no idea but it was good) and spicy sausage.  The smoked brisket and pork belly were to die for.  There was also this amazing mac and cheese. It was very cheesy and creamy, with extra large pasta noodle.  There was so much damn cheese that I felt like I needed scissors to cut the cheese as I was spooning it out of the pan.Omelette bar:  regular omelette bar with meat, veggie, and cheese toppings. I didn't get one, but La J did and it was tasty.  There was also bacon and sausage at this end of the bar to add to your omelette.Shrimp/Fresh Fruit bar: nice selection of fresh fruit and a heaping pile of nice looking shrimp.  I didn't do the shrimp because they are peel and eat...too much work for me, so I passed, but they looked amazing and had a great color.Dessert bar:  various pastries and mini parfait cups.  But the winner was the donut wall.  It was more like a donut peg board, but it worked.  The donuts that were provided were great cake donuts.  There must have been about 10-12 different flavors.Snack bar:  have never seen this before.  I have seen cereal at buffets, but this was a massive cereal, chips, candy bar: flaming hot Cheetos, Cracker's Jack, Twizzlers, Now Laters, etc.  That was crazy fun to see...I didn't get anything, but La J got some to go.The only issue I had, and it wasn't enough to ruin the meal, was the cups used for coffee.  The coffee was great and hot, but there were no cup sleeves for the cups.  I had to use a second cup in order to shield my hand from the heat because that coffee was nice and hot.  Not a game changer, but they might want to think about getting some of those in.This place is definitely a great location for brunch.  And the physical location means you can park on the street without spending $30 to park in a lot.",4.0,15,6,2

I loathe sitting in restaurants for a long time but at least there's something to occupy you here. The food is slightly above average bar grub. The eggrools & the pizza had to be the worst choices as they both tasted like frozen boxed foods from the grocery store. The highlights of the buffet were definitely the boozy desserts, the chicken sliders & Cinnamon peach butter that's an option for the cloud like waffles. The $20 bottomless mimosa option is a must & after the staff realize you're not a featherweight drinker they'll drop off entire bottles of champagne at your table. The music isn't obnoxiously loud like at Freemont but the place can seem crowded. Overall it's a decent option for brunch.",3.0,0,0,0

At first glance the food at this place is high end (lobster? wonton? gruyere? fancy encrusted descriptions?) for what seems a really low price in river north. Seemed too good to be true and it was. We shared the lobster nachos for happy hour and we both passed out immediately when we got home because of the heaviness of this dish and what I can only imagine to be msg in the food to make it extra ""tasty"". It's all super salty, slathered in cheese, and sprinkled with some tiny veggies. This is the second time we came here for their Thursday Moscow mule special but although a fun concept it is not worth the stomach cramp afterwards. They even had some fun looking dessert treats at the mule bar which turned out to taste so stale. I should have taken that as a warning and not ordered any more food.",1.0,1,0,3
4GPJGgO2egpNyNr8ZDu7SA,fEKUE_hIzur3XoHAzGOcvg,W2zno-nXaGa9Y2Au7L8wNA,4/26/2017,"I was looking for a solid brunch buffet option in the city to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday. After searching on Yelp for a bit, clearly the most popular suggestion was the epic brunch buffet at the Fremont. I looked on OpenTable and literally there is nothing available during brunch hours, even for the next two months. I tried calling them and no one ever picked up the phone. My friend suggested to check out Highline and when I looked it up, their flyer for the brunch buffet was the identical wording as Fremont's, except for the name. It turns out that both are owned by the Four Corners Tap Group and it's pretty much the same exact buffet, except $10 cheaper! It's $25 for the brunch buffet and then $15 more on top if you want bottomless mimosas.Ambiance: From what I heard, brunch at the Fremont is like a straight up day club. It's a younger crowd dressed to impress and they put a big emphasis on the boozy part of boozy brunch haha. The atmosphere at Highline seemed to be more low key. There was still good music playing, and people were gettin loose, but no one was forming a dance floor or anything haha. Everyone just seemed to be enjoying good food and good company.Drinks: None of us got the bottomless mimosas deal, but from what I saw it was pour your own drinks. There was a bucket of orange juice and other juices, and then an open bottle of champagne to mix it with. I'm definitely on board for self-service mimosas.Food: I was pretty impressed by the brunch buffet offerings. It was good ol American bar food. Instead of plates, you put your food on these lined metal trays that look like they're from a prison cafeteria. I didn't mind though because it was more space to fit all the food on there haha. SidesThere were a bunch of sides like garlic potatoes, sweet potato fries, broccoli rabe, and mac and cheese. The clear standout was the mac and cheese. Damnnn that was super creamy and cheesy. Even spooning it onto your plate left a never ending trail of oozing strands of cheese.Carving stationThey were serving hot links and sliced brisket. The brisket was a little on the dry side but the flavor was good. Omelette barStandard omelette bar with meat, veggie, and cheese toppings. I'm was too impatient to wait for one but they looked pretty good.Breakfast meatsThey had the usual offering of bacon and sausage patties. Then they had a bin of pre-made breakfast sandwiches that had sausage, cheese, tomato, and a fried egg in an english muffin. The meat was delicious but I'd pass on the sandwiches. It was very dry and the muffins were a little tough. DessertVarious pastries and mini parfait cups.Snack counterNow this is the section that was the most eye catching and unique part of the buffet. I would describe it as a candy store straight out of the 90s. Nostalgia galore. They had a little bit of everything: bags of chips, jars of gummies and hard candies, twizzlers, fruit by the foot, pudding cups, pop tarts, oreos, you name it. I also saw a bottle of Kool-aid Bursts on someone's table but I couldn't find that anywhere.Waffle barIt's like the waffle machine you see at hotel breakfasts, but with a shit ton of toppings. Fruit, whip cream, chocolate, etc. AppetizersThere were boneless chicken wings with some sort of sweet and spicy sriracha based sauce, which were really good. I just wished they refilled these more. I could've eaten a whole plate of them. They also had fried mac and cheese balls, which I found a little on the dry side. SandwichesThere mini sliders and chicken sandwiches. The chicken sandwich definitely had a kick to it. It was a breaded patty with a spicy dry rub and then topped with some coleslaw. The mini cheeseburger was also great. I loved that they used Merkt's cheddar spread instead of a traditional slice of cheese. Nacho barThere had a slow cooker full of nacho cheese that you could pour onto nacho chips or pretzel balls. Cold cutsCharcuterie board full of cubed meats and cheeses. There was also a hot sauce rack right next to it, so it seemed this could've been a bloody mary topping bar too. Donut wallThere was a pegged board that had donuts hung on them for the taking. I think someone said they were from the Doughnut Vault down the street. The majority of them were different varieties of buttermilk old fashioned donuts. The food was good, but it definitely starts getting crowded after 12:30 and the refills seem to slow down quite a bit the closer you get to 2PM. The donut wall was completely empty when we left at 2.Overall, I thought the brunch buffet at Highline was pretty legit. Especially in Chicago, you could easily spend $25 for brunch for a lot less variety/volume.",4.0,27,13,15

I stumbled upon this place randomly in my new work area and I can't  get enough of their leafy crunchy salads.  Here's my top picks : - harvest bowl (720 calories) a bit on the caloric side but this warm bowl is packed with goodness. Piled on top of a base of kale; quinoa and goat cheese are mixed with chicken and almonds. The dressing is a balsamic base and tastes absolutely amazing. The sweet potatoes added to it give it a nice kick. -kale Caesar: easily my top favorite salad from this place. At 420 calories , it's hard to believe this alternative Caesar salad is so good tasting and super healthy. My favorite part about it is there freshly squeezed lime they squeeze in to each order. Salads are warm bowls vary in price between 9-13 dollars. Completely worth the portion size and usage of fresh Ingredients.  Great alternative to the boring favorites of Panera bread and Corner bakery in my opinion.They have an online app available for download with a generous point system that allows you to redeem for credit towards food.

Since I heard such good things about this place I committed and decided to wait. There were about 8 people in front of me but oh my goodness, it should not take that long to toss a salad. Especially when all the ingredients are fresh and right in front of you.I felt like the way they were set up was not efficient at all. One person would basically do everything. Get all the ingredients, mix the salad, and ring you up. Then another person steps in and it all starts over again. I think that having at least 2 people on the line and a designated cashier would help things move a little faster. Not sure why there were like 4 people just standing around doing other things in the back when there was obviously a line full of customers. The guy in front of me was not having it and just gave up, which is probably what I should have done as well.As for the salad, I got the spicy sabzi.

Alas, this occasion fell a little short in some respects. The Chilean sea bass ($49) with shrimp ragout that I ordered was very good, though based on my earlier experience with the whitefish (see earlier review) I was hoping it would be extraordinary. One of our party ordered the whitefish (prepared slightly differently than it had been at our lunch) and said it was very good. The generous serving of seafood spaghettini ($26) was good as was the stuffed Walleye ($36), especially the crayfish sauce. The prime rib, on special ($40) Saturday nights only, was ordered medium rare and came out quite chewy as opposed to tender. The accompanying fries, sadly, were uninspired in terms of crispy crunch and were not very hot when served. Bread does not come with the meals but you could order the Miso Brioche Rolls appetizer for $7. The complimentary cherry pie dessert was a nice birthday touch. The service was fine overall. The only glitch was when we ordered a good bottle of Champagne and it came to the table at room temperature. The server agreed, when asked, to take it back and chill it more, but we ended up drinking the birthday toast with lukewarm bubbles and half of dinner was over before the bottle reappeared. (Just for comparison, once when we ordered a bottle of luxury champagne at another restaurant and the owner/sommelier realized it wasn't chilled, he explained that he would chill it before he opened it and offered us all while we waited a complimentary glass of a bubbly that was the correct temperature.)  Tortoise Supper Club is a warm, handsome place.

We ordered the Relish Tray and Ahi Tuna Poke. Our server was kind, but after we told him we only wanted appetizers, he barely visited our table. We saw the busser more than we saw him. The Relish Tray was presented beautifully and each item tasted Great! I loved the marinated olives, house made mixed nuts, and pimento cheese and pretzel toast the Best. I'm not a fan of beets, but these were very tasty. The bread and butter pickles were tangy and a little powerful in flavor. The mozzarella and sopressata was fine, although the sopressata was sparse.   The Ahi Tuna Poke was lovely in presentation and had delicious flavors and the chips were crisp. I asked the busser for more chips (we were ok with paying extra if there was a charge) but never heard back from him.

We were there for less than an hour, but felt the service just wasn't there for us.

Service was aMAHzing- from the free champagne for my friend's birthday, to the attentive service of the manager and server, to the patience when dealing with my friends' million allergies and preferences.

I definitely fell in love with this pizza from my first bite. There was a nice cheese pull to it, but I feel it could be stringier if the pizza was a little warmer because I felt that our pizza was left out a little long. Nonetheless, the sausage and tomato sauce goes well with each other. The sauce isn't heavy or overwhelming and I'm honestly very impressed that by how delicious deep dish pizza truly is.I personally feel that the personal is honestly enough to feed one very hungry person.

I would recommend this appetizer to anyone!Overall experience here was great, but the customer service was disappointing. Our server was completely overwhelmed and took it out on our table. He would cut us off when we'd try to order more items. And when it was time to pay for the bill, he gave my friend an attitude stating he has a lot of tables to serve and he can't help her.

I never planned on going to Lou Malnati's, particularly because of its mainstream vibe and long lines-- still, I was forced into it by a friend. Here's my experience:You walk into Lou's knowing it's going to be busy-- add to that the standard 45 minute wait for a deep dish and you've got quite the wait. Use that wait to order appetizers! The atmosphere here is great; there's always a crowd and while it gets VERY packed, it keeps things entertaining. The service is great as well and servers manage to be extremely attentive and friendly (a recurring theme in Chicago). The food here is good-- you won't be disappointed. But the deep dish left me wanting for more. This was my first authentic deep dish in Chicago and I couldn't help but feel that the spot was way overhyped. So I went to Pequod's (see my review on their page) and my expectations were blown out of the water. Still, Lou Malnati's has decent pizza and food/drinks-- you won't be let down that easily.I liked:Mozzarella Sticks - A classic appetizer, Lou Malnati's did not mess these up.I disliked:Deep Dish - It wasn't bad by any means, but the overall taste and quality of the ingredients simply didn't match up with smaller, lesser-known competitors.",4.0,0,0,0

Be prepared to wait about 30-40 minutes for your freshly made pizza. Don't worry about the time because you will want to try out the soup, salad, or other appetizers. The salads are shareable and worth a try. I loved the pizza so much that I decided to try the dessert cookie pizza! No complaints! Get the bigger portion ($7.25)...you won't regret it!

On September 27, 2017 at 11:55 PM I walked into Bijans Bistros (663 N State St Chicago, IL  60654) to pick up a pre-placed order by a guest who placed it through the ""Postmates App"" Unfortunately, due to technical issues the company credit card did NOT work with your POS System. Previously, with Postmates, I have done over 65 deliveries and never had an issue with the card having enough funds or being approved, hence it's a company credit card. It is the only way I was able to pay due to company policy. I had no cash and am not allowed to used personal debit/credit cards as part of my agreement with Postmates.I was held against my will by different members of the staff. A female server who insisted someone had to pay for the order before I could leave. Indirectly saying 'either I'm paying for this food or you are'.A bartender who interrogated me and asked me to explain the situation. A manager who told me to wait while he made a phone call to his ""boss"" and get approval for me to leave. After 15 minutes , I canceled the order via the PM app. I told them I was no longer responsible for the food, gave the food back and requested permission to leave. In an effort to leave professionally and not make a scene by walking out while they fixed the issue. I was told NO. That I couldn't just walk out on a open check.After about 20 minutes I expressed urgency as it was 12:15am I had been held there for 20 minutes and I had to catch the last train at union station (12:40am) Again I was told NO, I couldn't leave until the situation had been handled. I was about 5 minutes away from calling the police for being held against my will over an order that I personally did not place.Finally after 30 minutes of this nonsense, the guest who originally placed the order called the restaurant and explained to the staff what had happened and that another courier was on the way to pick up the food. I was then told It was ok for me to leave. I walked out around 12:25AM. And noticed my bicycle which had been locked up right next to the front door of the restaurant was tampered with. A $20 headlight was stolen from me. Again, I have done over 65 deliveries and never had anyone mess with my bike. All of which , I personally feel like could of been avoided had I not been held hostage for 30 minutes. Please contact me back. Please check your CCTV surveillance for the theft of my property. The body language of your staff during this confrontation. I even had a restaurant guest approach me and tell me everything was going to be resolved as he could pick up on the vibes that something was wrong. I will take any steps necessary to authenticate this post. Everything I have written is 100 percent accurate. I feel like filing a police report is an over reaction or even threatening to sue is an exaggeration.

The mezzanine area was great for chilling out and DJ spinning, but the real action took place downstairs. There was a medium sized dance floor area with black lighting, a huge bar, ping pong tables galore, and there was a talented aerial silk artist who performed from the ceiling in her own protected area. She was truly one of the highlights for me. I'm not sure if she's a regular, but just know they offer that as an option. There were some outside vendors who came in and set up in the upstairs area. There was enough room for glitter tattoos, psychic readings, photo booth, and face painting. It's nice to see the revival of ping pong from days in the past.

I want to be constructive so I'll try to keep my emotions at Bay. This was my first visit. I paid online to reserve a table for a party of 4 for 2 hours. I did this because the other ping pong bar I called was booked until 10pm and I didn't want to be stuck hanging out there for hours waiting to play. The total was $118.00.When we arrived we immediately ordered some food and drink. Our waitress brought out the food and delivered the check immediately. Unusual considering we just got there and for all she knows we'd be ordering much more. When we reviewed the bill we saw that she charged us for the food and an hour of play which we already paid for online. It was here that we realized that they charge $39/hour if you walk in and pay versus $59/hour if you book online. That's pretty ridiculous. On top that she charged my credit card and my friends credit card each for that hour. So in our first hour our single party paid two hours plus the prepaid two hours.Are you still with me? Super confusing!That all said, we ended up spending the entire night trying to get the bill settled and the waitress seemed to not understand the issue. We sent the bill back 4 times, saw the manager twice and I still see the same charges on my credit card with no refunds. On top of that, when the hostess came to collect our ping pong gear at the end of our game and asked how things went we explained the situation and she offered to once and for all help get this resolved. After doing so our waitress came up in a tizzy and proceeded to reprimand me for speaking to the hostess and not her. The final issue we we're trying to get fixed is that they still attempted to charge us tax on the food we ordered plus the $118 game we had already purchased. So we were taxed on $150 instead of $40.   I'm not really sure if that ever got resolved. We we're so over it by the end of the night we just gave up and left. All this to say that we had a GREAT time playing ping pong. The atmosphere was fun, music was great ( a little too loud though) but our timed two hour game was definitely interrupted by the constant negotiating of the bill in the middle of the game. To SPiN: please advise your wait staff to deliver the bill at the end of the game so our marked up game isn't waisted.",3.0,1,0,1

It has a great location right by the House of Blues, coordinating going to a show there can be complicated (think queuing, tons and tons of queuing) so going here before or after would be pretty great, much lower time commitment than the nearby bowling option and more seating. It also has very cool decor.The food is just okay. At events they have these risotto rice balls they pass around that everyone refuses cos, newsflash, they are not good!

My parents ordered the mild and my sister and I ordered the spicy. To be honest, both of them lacked spice. The mild one needed a little more salt and the spicy one needed at least another jalapeno but it was still so delicious that we all devoured both of the servings. However, when it came to the main dish, I was blown away, as was my whole family. The majority of us got steak tacos and it was by far the BEST steak tacos I have yet to have.

I swear the amount of space for just our table was bigger than my studio apartment. It was just kind of weird and felt awkward. But the views of surrounding River North out the floor-to-curling widows was really show-stopping. The food also was just slightly off, despite great potential. The guac was made tableside, which was fun! But the woman who was making it asked how spicy we wanted it -- mild, medium, or hot. We said hot, but it just tasted like a mild mash of avocado, and I'm a wimp when it comes to spicy foods! Trying to scoop it up was also next to impossible, as the chips were so thin they kept breaking. And the tacos, while beautifully plated, were also just so-so. Overall, I felt like Cantina Laredo had a confused identity. The vibe of the restaurant and prices on the menu seemed to trend towards upscale.

They did a lot of classic hip hop and R&B but also songs from imagine dragons and other genres of music. When they starting singing gin and juice, next episode, killing me softly and other classics, I was going nuts. It was great!! I was singing my heart out and was worried I was going to lose my voice ! The bathroom was clean and they have everything a woman would need there like perfume, mints, sanitary napkins. There is a woman there standing to help you out and also waiting for tips. The band will keep reminding you to drink or give them tips lol. All in all, a great evening and I hope to be back for more !!",4.0,7,5,5

The Bassment touted having live music and craft cocktails. The pictures online showed Jimi Hendrix and Salvador Dali painted on the walls of a vintage, 1960's Britain inspired, funky lounge.  We expected to have good drinks and music. The line we waited in was a marketing fraud, but we played along. When it was our turn, we paid our $10 cover charge to two bouncers that seemed to have the power to change the entrance rules at random proposals. They opened the ""secret bookcase"" that reminded me of a stage prop from the ""Wizarding World of Harry Potter"" at Universal Studios and we went inside. The bar was full of other patrons cramming together in hopes of placing an order for one of the amazing craft cocktails. After 40 minutes, we were able to order one the famous bathtub gin cocktails that are served in a mini bathtub with a rubber ducky floating. They were unique for sure. Even with one of my faucets broken off and the unfortunate loss of half of the contents due to the other bar patrons aggressively pushing for their turn at the bar, therefore causing the contents of my cocktail to spill down my arm, I was happy to sip what was left--and it was good. We ended up beside an entertaining group of middle aged white people that really enjoyed dancing to ""Dirty Diana"" but struggled a bit with the lyrics. Specifically all of the lyrics except for ""Dirty Diana."" They were, however, able to enthusiastically sing that in unison as they fist pumped off beat with their left arm while holding their cocktail in their right while simultaneously slightly bending their knees up and down to yet a different beat. It was impressive and our friends from LA wanted to know if that was a special dance exclusive to Chicago. It is not. We did not attempt to get another drink and I placed my empty, one fauceted, mini bathtub on the shelf before surrendering and heading to another bar. The idea of ""The Bassment"" is great, but we were underwhelmed with the experience.",2.0,2,0,2

While we have been to the Hampton Social several times, we never realized that the Bassment was here, probably because there is a secret entrance through a fake cigar store front! We made reservations ahead of time, which is recommended because depending on the night, due to capacity, they do not accept walk ins. This also adds to the very private/exclusive vibe.We ordered the bathtub drink, because Instagram.. and it was delicious! The drinks are expensive, but in this case you definitely get what you pay for.We also ordered the fig and prosciutto pizza and the Calabrese Salami (pepperoni) pizza. Both were great. Each pizza probably feeds 2-3 people. We were told when making a reservation that the seating is reserved for parties that purchase bottle service. However, when we arrived we were told we could sit anywhere we liked until a reservation arrived. Similar to what others have written in their reviews, we were fine all night, even once it got pretty crowded, and I did't notice anyone being asked to move. Unless you know you want the bottle service I would not feel pressured to pay in advance. Plus, the music was so great that you will probably spend most of the night on the dance floor anyways!I would highly recommend checking this place out. Our reservations were for 9:30pm and I would say that anywhere between 9:30pm-10pm was the perfect time to get there and grab a couch, before it gets too crowded!",5.0,4,3,1

We didn't quite know where to sit, since it looked like every spot was reserved. And when we asked a guy, he told us, ""You'd know if you had a table."" We did not, so I guess we did not. However, he was super nice and went, ""Just sit and you can move if anyone asks."" We got there at about 8:30pm and left at 10:30pm and no one asked us to move.However, this is clearly a spot that gets busier the later in the night it is, as we saw is slowly but surely fill up.The band on a Friday night was EPIC, this amazing seven or eight piece band that did covers of motown, r&b and 80's classics. Loved them, and apparently they're there every Friday, so don't miss it.The cocktails are solidly made, but damn expensive at like $16 a pop. Yikes, if you're going to drink here all night long, it's going to add up.

Friday night some friends and I had a late dinner and while walking home, decided to stop in around 1:15. There was no line and when we walked up they said it would be $10 each. They were closing soon so we said no thanks. Suddenly, it was no problem, come on in, no fee. Alright then. We got downstairs and headed to the bar. Everyone else got a beer, and I had an old fashioned. The beer selection wasn't great, but it could have been worse. My old fashioned was well made, but it didn't stand out as spectacular for the price. We moved closer to the stage and stood to listen to the music. The band was great, with a mix of instruments and rap. This place closes at 2, and around 1:40 the band wrapped up. We weren't done with our drinks and a bouncer came over and started trying to herd us to the door. A friend said we'd leave, but we weren't ready or done with the drinks we paid for. The bouncer is apparently very important and powerful, because he started shoving my friend toward the door and making us all leave. He then made a snotty comment about how he ""did us a favor"" by letting us in for free. For free 45 minutes before close, thanks buddy. This guy was extremely confrontational and made me feel uncomfortable and unsafe. We snapped a photo of him as we followed our friend out, just in case, and the guy did not like that. It's 2018 man, if you're gonna act like a jerk, it's probably gonna get documented. On the way out there was a manager near the door and I tried to explain what had happened, and he said he'd take care of it. Though I highly doubt that will happen.

Small space, but it is packed with too much good stuff - I wanted everything! (so though I didn't have Raw on my need-to-go list, I do try to live a healthy life).  I went with the spirulina grapefruit smoothie on her recommendation (I added ginger because it is an obsession of mine) and it was so much more than simply a combo of the ingredients - thick, slightly sweet, creamy and tart.  SO good.  Filling?  Not really, but I didn't expect it to be.Also grabbed a cranberry muffin to go - this was not my fave.  You knew it was super dense just by picking it up, but it is SUPER dense and a bit dry.  If you go into it thinking more granola bar and not muffin, you will be better prepared.  Flavours were tasty, though (a whole lotta cinnamon).Many of their prepared dishes sounded awesome, but I didn't have the ability to heat anything up, so decided to forgo these.  Darn it.  The falafel, meatballs, and burgers all looked intriguing.  The portion sizes looked perfect to be a complete and filling meal.  If you have a sweet tooth, this is your place: cheesecakes, truffles, lemon bars, apple pies, chocolate mousse, ice creams...you could go crazy (and broke).Of the 4 folks in there in addition to myself, 3 were obviously regulars.  That says somethin.Yes, the prices are a bit steep.  But if you are a foodie, and spend good money dining out anyhow, then take a break every once in a while from the heavier and indulgent meals (which I absolutely believe have their place) and indulge in this goodness.  Your taste buds and body will thank you.",5.0,1,1,0

Raw zucchini pasta- 4 stars.Sweet potato chips- 4 stars, super good!Sushi- 5 stars! Things I plan to try:Raw empanadas looked amazing, as did the sandwiches (the ""bread"" is made of sprouted grains!)  Give me a few months and I will have tasted the entire store (and updated my review accordingly.)Side rant: The one thing I don't care for is how some items are labeled with non-vegan names, for example ""salmon pate.""  I find this off-putting because the goal should be to entice people to appreciate vegan food for its wholesome ingredients, not under the guise of something else.  Just call it what it is, so people can actually know and appreciate what they're eating.",5.0,1,1,0

The app samplings that they had coming around all tasted okay, but nothing mind blowing.The not-so-good: The music was far too loud.

At night, they light up the stringed lights across the top of the roof, which makes for a romantic and cozy experience.

Naturally, special treatment was applied. Thanks friend for all you did! We came here specifically for the rooftop lounge and it was a blast prior to the storm that decided to rain on our parade. Gogo girls had bubble machine guns, everyone was dancing, and we had a table under a beautiful red and white stripped awning. We rushed inside to take cover. The next level down was the dance club. This space is amazing and the energy was high! It felt like mini Vegas. Tubular shaped light fixtures move up and down from the ceiling while changing colors, there's a huge screen behind the DJ booth, sound system is so good my eardrums we're shaking, smoke shoots out of the walls every so often, and the music was great we danced to every song! Opted out of $300 bottle service bc we would have lost the table after 1hr and 40min, if a $1000 spender arrived and bc their  reservation list was filled. We moved levels and decided on grabbing some appetizers to eat. We had miso chips, lobster egg rolls, chicken lollipops, and a plethora of complimentary drinks. Everything was great but the lobster egg rolls could have used some flavor. There was some miscommunication with the birthday girl and the bouncer but management was extremely apologetic and compensated us for the trouble. A+ for great management.

I'm so upset, that I'm sitting here waiting for my check to be fixed (for the fourth time) and writing this terrible review. WHAT ON EARTH IS WRONG HERE?Our server was an fn nightmare. Literally start to finish, the worst I've ever experience ever. Maria, I normally don't call anyone out by names, because I think that's unfair. But Jesus this was terrible. We asked to follow up multiple times on our drinks, she forgot my order, asked for it again, and still gave me the wrong food. Here's the best part... she added random drinks to our menu, we asked she take them off. She made a big deal about having to ""completely redo"" our bill. Okay? You added drinks? I think everyone was aware that not just our table, but many of her tables were frustrated with the service. So when we finally received our ""correct bill"" I lost it. She added 20% gratuity which I'm sure is their policy, but Jesus the service was the worst I've ever had! So then I found a gentleman that's been helping her all evening, I approached him asking if he was the manager. Smugly, he answered ""no I'm the owner"". I replied by telling him how terrible our experience was and that we felt 18% tip was much more reasonable. I realize that's petty, but it's about the principle. She literally forgot multiple drinks. He was unamused and didn't care to mediate. Just took the gratuity off.But of course, it doesn't end here!! He passes it on to Maria and she of course comes by to ask us why she had to charge us again. She was so annoyed and told us AGAIN ""okay well I guess I have to completely redo this again"" girl. Get. It. Together. An hour later, we finally signed our bill and left. I'll never be back which sucks because the food was great. Great burger by the way.",1.0,21,0,6

They do have a drive through, but that can get backed up quickly, as the location is right on the corner of a massively busy intersection/one way street. I suggest Ubering here if you're coming for late night food. They do have a very small outdoor patio area you can eat. No wifi available. The food can occasionally be a hit or miss here. I have come here at times where the bread was hard as a rock, the beef was clearly someone scraping the bottom of the pan and giving tiny pieces of beef in the sandwich, someone dumping way too many hot peppers only in the center of the sandwich, etc. For the most part though, you can't go wrong with it. The beef sandwiches are very good.

The sandwich was an absolute flavor bomb. Every thin slice of meat carried nothing but the best intentions with it. The bread was sturdy and held up well, especially when you consider the extra jus that was added to the sandwich.This was my first true Chicago style hot dog. I don't know what kind of hot dogs I've been eating in my life, but I only want Chicago style ones from here on out. The all beef vienna, mixed with celery salt, that neon green relish and peppers is incomparable.

All in all a great experience from our friendly waitress to the build your own bloody mary bar and the live music. What more could you want on a Sunday funday?Location: Bub City you will find on the Northeast corner of Clark & Hubbard with the entry way off Clark streetInitial thoughts of ambiance... scents of BBQ fill the air, a country bar, All-American judging from the beer can flag assembled over the bar, low lit, a bit grimy feeling that you get from visiting a small music venue, writing all over the wall downstairs near the restroom and a surprise mannequin in the ladies room as I've heard. For Sundays they offer their twist on a typical Southern meat and three, where you get a choice of a main entree and three sides and a drink (non alcoholic) for $16.95. Great deal if your on the hungry side and easily could split this between two peeps. I ended up ordering their burnt ends brisket hashbrown for $7 with the fried eggs on top for an extra $2. All in all, I have to say their food is rich, heavy, and delicious and will definitely cure any sort of hangover you may have acquired from the night before. I also have to say their build your own bloody is quite the experience in itself. For $12, you get one trip to their dedicated bloody bar where you pick your poison (choice of select vodkas or whiskey), bloody mix, and all the condiments you can assembly and stack within the cup with in one trip. They got everything from spices, pickles, jerky sticks, assorted cheese, deviled eggs, mini grilled cheese sandwiches, veggies, and mini bottled high life beers. Top notch bloody bar in my opinion.Overall, great spot to do brunch. They are part of the lettuce entertain you group, so have those cards ready to rack up them points and rewards.

A friend and I went for Restaurant Week, and despite a 7pm reservation, we were not seated for 45 minutes. The table we were eventually seated at was directly next to a very drafty window in a corner apparently out of sight from any server. We were not given menus and after 20 minutes finally found our own at the bar. Finally a sever noticed us (maybe the excessive waving helped?) and we placed our order. First course, I ordered the frog legs and my friend ordered the onion soup. Onion soup was pretty good, but I was served escargot aka not what I ordered... 20 more minutes to correct the incorrect order (the server did not leave the escargot, so no review there), and it was average at best. Second course, we both ordered beef bourguignon to make it easy. Potatoes were good and the dish was heavy enough that our excessive hunger was satisfied. We were never given water though, so that wasn't great. Third course, I ordered the tarte aux pommes and my friend ordered the profiteroles. Guess what- we both get profiteroles because that's all they have left. The server tries to sell them up as ""world class,"" but they were pretty dry and since it wasn't what I ordered in the first place, I was less than enthused. As we're eating, the table next to us is offered their choice of any menu dessert since surprise- the restaurant is now out of every dessert. At this point it has been 3 hours, and although we were offered free wine, we just want to leave. We had to go outside twice now to add money to the parking meter. It took directly going to the bar with our cards and asking them to close out the tab to make that happen. Luckily my friend is a good sport, and we found humor in how everything seemed to go wrong.

The restaurant is small and intimate with a take on classic French themes ( dark reds/blacks/whites, vintage French portraits, glass chandeliers etc.). The dishes for the night were two appetizers : 'Lobster bisque' ( a bit on the more sea food tasting spectrum ) and the 'Foie Gras Maison' (served with a side of shallot/raisin chutney & crackers). I preferred the foie gras which was creamy , a perfect pairing with the chutney . Next for the two entrees we ordered the 'Filet de Boeuf Louis XIV"" (filet mignon , seared foie gras , fingerling potatoes, and haricot vert aka sting beans) and the ' Cotelettes d' agneau' ( rack of lamb , cherry reduction , potato gratin and haricot vert aka string beans). Both entrees were succulent , the meats melting in our mouths , a perfect pairing with all the sides. Lastly the two desserts chosen to end the night were the Molleux Au chocolat (chocolate molten cake with vanilla ice cream ) and a classic take on the French puff pasties filled with creme topped with chocolate and a side of vanilla ice cream , both delicious and a great ending to our Valentine's Day dinner. I would rate the food as a 8/10 for both taste and presentation . The only thing that I would modify would be better management with handling the transition of diners and others whom are waiting to be seated . We had started an enjoyable conversation with the couple next to us towards the end of our meal, which continued onwards once the bill was collected . One of the staff members came over to rush the couple next to us and us out as we hadn't even stood up to get our coats due to the others waiting to be seated . I believe they could have been more professional handling the transition as we did pay for dinner and it was Valentine's Day .**An update to correct the staff members response below . It was horrible weather on 02/14/16 , with heavy snow , we had called & made sure we updated the restaurant to notify them of our late arrival due to a couple accidents on the way from the suburbs to Chicago. We had left early to compensate for weather , but unfortunately arrived late again due to the horrible weather. The staff member notified us that there was no problem with that. Not once did anyone at the restaurant mention "" there will be a time limit to our table"". The restaurant was almost more than half empty when we arrived (even 45 minutes late). Secondly , the manager never mentioned a ""complimentary "" drink at the bar to compensate for other diners waiting. He simply rushed the couple and us out , mentioning others need to be seated . In my almost 25 years of dining history of thousands of restaurants/ dining establishments , I've never been told we must rush out of our table if others are waiting to be seated ... Even if we arrived "" on time "" , would the owner kick us out of our table ? Lastly , you must be wrong , the "" Foie Gras"" was not "" complimentary"" by any standard, that was part of the Valentine's Prix-Fix menu , where we each ordered one appetizer , the lobster bisque & foie gras... Where was that "" complimentary "".I thought I was being very generous and courteous  writing the original review (above) , where I could have simply given ""one star"" & only mentioned how poorly we were treated towards the end of our Valentine's dinner being rushed out in that manner, after paying $120+ on dinner. I am now in disgust due to the false statements here instead of an apology . Thus why I will drop my rating to what should have been the original rating of one star. The owner, Ned B,  should learn how to run a more decent business and not falsify statements for his benefit. We will not be returning to BV, due to the lack of respect and conniving antics!

While I knew the wine here was always top notch, I never expected the food to surpass the wine picks in quality and variety. We started with the truffle fries (really you can never go wrong!) and the polenta and then made our way to the mussels and an assortment of bruschettas. Honestly I did not dislike a single thing. The stand outs to me were the polenta and the artichoke bruschetta. Our server was exceptional and was kind enough to bring out birthday desserts for us as well.

Meli's banana bread is a slightly different take than your classic quick bread - it had a crust and texture of a risen yeast bread. You get all the banana and spice flavor without the heavy quality of a typical banana bread. I also ordered a strawberry, orange, and banana juice, but sadly that banana got missed from the order. The strawberry orange juice was still delicious, but not exactly what I was craving to accompany by banana bonanza. Construction was happening in the ladies' room, so a server sent me into the men's. He then sent another person in my party in behind me after about a minute, which was a little weird since there was only one stall. I later was able to use the ladies' room, and unfortunately the horrible smell from the men's also permeated there; it must be a plumbing issue (that is hopefully being caused by or fixed with the construction). If you've got a big appetite or want a wide array of choices for breakfast, Meli is a great choice.",4.0,0,1,0

It's a little bit pricey (nothing too crazy) but totally worth it in my opinion. They have a juice bar with smoothies and juices- all for different purposes (diet drinks, drinks that promote clear skin etc.). They have everything... I mean that almost literally haha. I assumed this brunch would mess up my diet but  nope- they had a ""healthy start"" section. I ordered an egg white scrambler. My friends got chicken and waffles, French toast, a salad and a jalapeño breakfast bowl. They literally have so many choices! Omelettes, burgers, salads, vegan& gluten free options, pancakes, French toasts, smoothies etc. Wonderful variety!  Everything was good! I tried a bit of each plate and honestly there was not a single one I disliked. The Meli salad was very good (would highly recommend to a feta lover). The chicken and waffles are also bomb and come with an egg which is a nice touch! My egg white scrambler, like all the other dishes, was HUGE. I really enjoyed it with hot sauce (which they also provide). The portions are very large and delicious so I think they are worth the price.

The savoriness of the scallion cream cheese was nicely paired with the freshness of the lox (yes, they do give out fresh lox).The clearest difference to me between my order and what I had in New York was the texture of the bagels.

Made me forget about just every disturbing thing I have learned about ducks on Planet Earth.

It was a genuine medium rare to the core, which means toddler sized bites or else you will be chewing the same piece for longer than the restaurant has been established.

The waiter worked hard to please us and we were amazed by his service. Next, we were surprised by the food quality. The chef was wonderful and every item that we ordered tasted deliciously. Also, we got a complimentary desserts that was a nice gesture from the waiter.Of course, In Chicago you have many choices of the places to eat.

What I can speak to is how well everything was cooked, particularly the roasted beef tenderloin, which was the standout of the evening. We had a 4-course meal, starting with a delicious butternut squash soup with smoked duck. It was the perfect opening course for dinner on a cool fall night. An enjoyable beet salad followed, highlighted by the sweetness from the beets, apples, and candied pecans. By far, the star of the meal was the beef tenderloin. The meat was packed with flavor and had the buttery texture you expect from a well-cooked tenderloin. It was complimented by delicious goat cheese glazed potatoes and Hen of the Woods mushrooms. And while the dessert course was good (custard cake), my mind kept drifting back to that wonderful tenderloin.

I had been anticipating my visit for a while, so I am pleased that all the exceptional things I heard about Naha were true.I was shocked to find that a large part of our duration spent at Naha, the dining room was nowhere near capacity. Location wise Naha is positioned right in the heart of the hustle and bustle of the touristy River North. If anyone does research before visiting the city, they know to expect world class food and Naha - because of the Michelin star rating - would certainly be on that list. To find the dining room about half full all things considered...I was shocked. In a way I am thankful that the restaurant was not as busy as it could've been on a Saturday night because it allowed me to truly take in the decor and the scenery. Oftentimes I find myself critiquing the aesthetic of the space as much as the food. Naha didn't disappoint on either spectrum. I loved the unique artwork placed around the room, the massive windows overlooking the street, the crisp white tablecloths, and the plant displays in the dining room. The wait staff are all well dressed and spoken, as well as courteous - definitely adding to the casually elegant ambience. Our primary server was very attentive, offered great recommendations, and was quite funny.For dinner I ordered the grilled quail and the sturgeon. One of my girlfriends ordered the steak frites (against my better judgement). The assorted bread plate came first accompanied by a small dish of fresh butter. The breads are extremely delicious. Careful. You can get full off the bread here.The quail dish was a+mazing. My first experience with the bird itself, and I am now a huge fan. The quail had tender and juicy flesh, with crispy and perfectly seasoned skin. Just the way it should be. The asparagus was sauteed great, as were the oyster mushrooms. The polenta was so darned tasty thanks to the cream and the hint of goat cheese. The ingredients selected to accompany the quail were expertly chosen. This was also my first experience with sturgeon for which I am now a fan too. This dish was just as tasty as the quail, if not more. The texture of the sturgeon was interesting to begin with, but after each bite I became comfortable with the fact that it looks like a softer fish (like salmon) but isn't. Taste wise it is a very clean and sweet tasting fish, not too fishy tasting like a tuna. My favorite part about this dish were the sudden bursts of lemony flavor when I bit into a piece of the meyer lemon. The beautiful relationship between seafood and lemon is a tried and true tale as old as time. The marble potatoes were perfectly cooked and seasoned. When mixed with the romaine and gribiche, the clams were utterly fabulous also. My friend ordered the steak frites and ordered it medium well. She said she enjoyed it, however I was not a fan of the steak at all. I think it's more of the preference of doneness requested rather than the dish itself. I never request a steak to be cooked above medium. The frites and onions were delicious and so was the ashed goat cheese (so pungent and definitely a powerful bite)!Last but not least, the ricotta cake. A delicious dessert. The fruits were dried and crunchy. Mixing the ice cream with the sweet polenta, the cake, and the almonds...oh my. Just decadent. Overall it was just a great dinner. Very well deserving of the Michelin star because these dishes were so well thought out and executed. They were complex and intricate and multifaceted. 4.5 stars. .5 because the steak itself was not too good.",4.0,8,12,6

For starters, we had cauliflower soup and salad if house greens. The salad was refreshing and the soup was velvetty and delicious, roasted peanuts giving it the required crunchiness. I would definitely recommend the soup.For our next course, we had the duck breast and alaskan cod. I absolutely loved the duck. It was cooked to perfection and the sauce was delicious. I could have had one more portion easily . The fish was cooked well but i found it lacking both in presentation and taste. For dessert we had oeuf a la neige and the ottoman custard. Of the two, I preferred the latter. The presentation was beautiful on the glass plate. The lemon cream provided a perfect contrast to the sweet custard and the caramalized tuile gave it the perfect crunch. Highly recommended.

The service and atmosphere were both excellent, however.We had a very early reservation to make a show, and the restaurant was nearly empty. We felt no lack of attention as our silverware was restored between each course and our water glasses were refilled every 10 seconds.The drinks were definitely good, but overpriced even for Chicago. Expect to spend $15-$20 on a good-not-great cocktail. Our appetizer, a mushroom custard with duck egg, had great flavors. The texture of the custard with the egg yolk got quickly tiring, however. My main, the sea bass, wasn't great. The fish was slightly overcooked and dry. The rest of the dish didn't work very well - the sea berry mixture was far too tart/bitter - it cut through the thick sea bass and tipped the scales the other way. The large cracker with some sort of mustardy spread seemed out-of-place and didn't make flavor sense with the rest of the dish, to me.My sister had the duck, which, even cooked medium-rare, was VERY chewy. I understand that aged duck would be a little chewier, but I wish the chef would have considered jaw exhaustion when cooking.Naha was fine, but there are much better restaurants in the area for the pointlessly high price.",2.0,2,1,1
KxyoglibWbVUpAq4yedpbg,s7iq5dP-iLdivNGKr2wTJA,GNVnNr52dHF5NpGJGXUWEA,2/4/2017,"I had higher expectations for a Michelin-starred spot, but perhaps it's because I came during CRW.I love Chicago Restaurant Week because it's a great time for me to try places on my list. I've had NAHA on it for quite sometime but just never made it here until now. Yes it's usually pricey, but on par with other spots in River North, and especially since it does have one Michelin Star. After dining at many other places during this year's Restaurant Week, I will say I've experienced the worst service here. Not worst in general but amongst my CRW dining experiences. I don't think that just because we are ""paying less,"" we should get less service. That is how I felt here at NAHA tonight. If anything, the service should be even better than usual, so that I will want to come back for the regular menu. We waited very long between the app and entree courses and no one checked on us. Only the bus person who came to refill our water seemed concerned. Overall we were neglected and asked only once about the meal.I am one to weigh my ratings of restaurants more on the food than the service. I like to give service the benefit of the doubt. Sometimes people have a bad day. It's not an excuse, but I hate to judge so much on service alone unless you're Michelin starred. Now onto the food. I went with 3 other friends and we tried to order different dishes so that we can try more of the menu. The appetizers were good. Not life changing but good. I had the polenta and it wasn't memorable. My friends ordered the Burrata and the Beet Salad. I also orders two Kusshi oysters. I loved the oysters but they were pricey. I really enjoyed my duck, and I was left wanting more! I believe the Restaurant Week portion is smaller than the regular entree but I would definitely go back for it. My friends had the steak and the pork belly and it was all good. For the dessert we all ordered the Banana Streusel Tart. The tart crust part was to die for, but the bananas were lacking something. Overall I'm glad to try NAHA and check it off my list. Perhaps one day I will go back again for the duck. But there are just too many places I still haven't been to and the underwhelming service makes me not want to rush back.",3.0,3,3,7

The experience was painful and my business associate and I were very surprised at the lack of attention and sloppy service. Another pro tip: if you have a restaurant at Clark and Illinois you may want to have your valet situation sorted out. When I arrived I had to leave my car precariously perched on the corner because there no valet and some random staff member from the restaurant had to move it. When we left it took more then 40 minutes to get my car back and there was only one car before me. What pissed me off even more is that the waiter had brought our ticket to the hostess to call the valet so our car would be ready and she didn't bother calling them until we were standing there wondering where the car was. She was absolutely clueless and just made thing 100 time worse.I had high hope for Naha and it has been on my list for awhile. I should have been suspicious when on a Thursday night the restaurant only had 3 tables of people.

The broth should be flavored with a balanced mixture of soy, dashi, mirin, and sugar, for both a mildly sweet but salty profile. Cocoro's Oyakodon was disappointing (all I tasted was egg and bland chicken stock) and the texture was way off. When the rice at the bottom of the bowl soaks up the broth, it's really important to get the broth right. Bland broth = bland rice. *sad face*. And without adequate amounts of broth, you're also left with plain rice at the bottom of the bowl *another sad face*. The egg on top was way over cooked. It reminded me a lot of my mother's microwaved eggs. -a *sad face* doesn't even suffice for that one It's winter and I need my donburi fix, but it's clear that it's time to start making this at home.

The shredded egg is the best part, and unlike anything I have had.I'm not a huge fan of the ramen here, but I think it's just because they have a stronger ginger flavor in their broth and I happen to not like ginger.

The staff was supper friendly and welcomed us by giving us a complementary snow peas. We sat at the sushi bar so we can see our meal made in front of our faces. When we ordered our meal we asked a bunch of question not knowing what was on the menu. The sushi chef could hardly speak English but through some translation he was able to explain. Our food was superb!!! I never had sushi that fresh before. Not to mention it won't break the bank. If your ever in Chicago and want fresh authentic sushi I highly recommend restaurant.,5.0,0,0,0

The bartenders were very friendly and even gave us a complimentary shot.The bar is nice but very small for what they are trying to accomplish. We walked into a very crowded lower level and were escorted to our friends on the balcony which was pretty tiny and once the dancers started performing (about every 20 mins) it felt even smaller. We were asked to get off so they could dance which I understand but it put a damper on the our dancing. I feel like the balcony should only be for the dancers if its going to be that small. The bachelorette had bottle service, I walked in later than others and had a tequila drink shoved in my face by the server. I told her I was going to get my own drink and she did not take it, I thought that was a bit much. All in all I enjoyed the ambiance just didn't like being squished like a sardine.

My friends and I decided to check the place out last night around 10pm and easily got in. There was no line and the place wasn't too busy. Tables are reservation only but there was plenty of room to stand, but not for long....The place started to become packed and we soon found ourselves squashed in the crowd and pushed from every direction. I was able to finish half of my delicious Papa Doble before someone whacked my glass, causing my $14 drink to spill all over myself. A few seconds later, my glass is knocked out of my hand and onto the floor. At least the bouncer was apologetic and offered to get me another drink, but I was ready to get out of there. My friend and I were stuck against a wall while the glass was cleaned up. Some dumb child tried to start a fight with me over dropping my glass near her. I guess it was a good thing we couldn't move because I would have told her where to put that glass!On a positive note, it's a beautiful space and the cabaret show was fun, but this place is trying to be too many things. It's small and set up like a restaurant, so packing people in like sardines doesn't work. Everyone is either trying to get to or away from the bar and there's nowhere to move and no convenient place to stand and enjoy your drink. Also, people kept trying to dance so that just added to the crowded mess. I don't mind paying that much for a good cocktail, but not in an atmosphere where I'm being pushed nonstop! This is why Violet Hour and Lost Lakes concepts work. They don't squash everyone in to the point where you can't move. Maybe moving the tables in the middle area after a certain point would be better, especially if they want people to dance. The space is just too small for what they are trying to do.",1.0,12,1,3

Although we saw other people have a drink on fire so idk if our waitress was just wrong.. We tried 4 cocktails and I couldn't even tell you what was what because they all just tasted like sugar. Booty Collins was probably the least sweet. They were also giving complementary food towers, which were really cool. Empanadas and some sort of mini sandwiches on the bottom. Bite sized things on top. It was way too loud and we couldn't hear what was what. They said beef empanadas both time, but pretty sure it was lamb. It tasted suppppper gamey, but the crust was delicious. The chicken and shrimp bites on top were my favorite. The food probably has potential. Might be helpful to provide a written list so people know what's what. We also asked our waitress if there would be cabaret and she said yes very soon at 6:30. They didn't start until 7:30 or so when we were ready to leave. I expected more frequent performances. We caught one performance on the balcony. It wasn't normal cabaret.

The suggested we come and they would do there best to accommodate. We arrived at 8PM. There were 4 large booths, unoccupied. There were also 3 tables for 4, unoccupied. We got the speech from the hostess that they have reservations for the two 4 tops and the 4 large booths were reserved for bottle service at a $750. minimum. She said we were number 1 on the wait list. After 15 or 20 minutes of waiting, I went to find the manager. Ms Hostess, did not want to hunt of the manager standing next to her, but did begrudgingly. I explained that we only were going to stay for 60 to 90 minutes, and he finally let us have one of the 4 tops. The room is set up pretty nicely, with musicians and dancers on a balcony above. There were 4 rotating dancers this night. some were great, some adequate, but all trying their best. The music is a different story. This place is kinda karaoke style music. There is a DJ sitting off to the right. There is a conga drum player filling into the canned DJ music. There is also a guitar who does not really play, but pokes at his guitar to the music pretending to play. The conga drum player sings something on occasion, he needs to focus harder on his drum playing I think. One of the dancers lip synced some songs. Honestly, all the music comes via the DJ.This place, with its location, could be a hot spot in town. The concept is right, the execution is what is lacking.

I came here by accident having never heard of the bar and just popping in as an alternative to loud music from another place. The music here is obnoxiously loud also. My review is on the staff. After a member of my party admittedly drank too much, the bouncers ushered her out. That's fair and we all agreed she needed to go home. The issue started after we put her in a cab. The coat check let us place multiple items under one ticket. When my friend was in the cab, it made sense that someone should escort her home, but I didn't have my coat. The bouncer said he would stay with her at the cab while we went to grab my stuff. The coat check wouldn't give us our things because we had already taken one out of the many items on the ticket and they said we couldn't have had anything left behind. Then they said we had to come back the next day for our stuff. My personal and work phones were in my coat. They kicked us out after not giving us our stuff. In the midst of this, my wallet was left on the coat check table. Once everyone was outside, the bar closed with all of our things inside. Along the way, some random patron decided to get in my face and shit talk to me, because I kept pressing the bouncers to get me a manager so I could get my things. Now we were outside, without our stuff, and a jackass random guy harassing me. I repeatedly told the guy to leave us alone and back off. He didn't. I made a mistake and touched the guy, to which he responded by punching me in the face and then beating me to the ground. My friend tried to stop him and he turned on my friend, beating him up until after several minutes, the bouncers magically decided to DO THEIR JOBS (the first time that whole night!)

The event was a fundraiser for charity, and at the end of the night when the winner of a $1,000 raffle donated her winnings back to the charity, Bottled Blonde stepped up and rewarded her with a $1,000 gift card to the establishment, which was a fantastic gesture. Our experience there was nothing but excellent.Why the low rating? Well, before you walk inside you're accosted by a giant sign with the most ridiculous dress code I've ever seen (pictured). They could have saved a lot of money and gotten a much smaller sign that says WHITES ONLY, since we all know what these listed banned items really mean. And to top it off, the sign even says that if you are wearing something they deem unacceptable, even if you go home, change your clothes, and come back, they can still ban you from coming inside.

They followed this with tapas, smoked chicken empanada, a lamb taco, and plantain croquette.  Perfect tasty little bites.By the time we had finished the staters and tapas we were pretty much full but onward we ventured to the main course.  I definitely recommend the two courses we ordered the skirt steak with aji-amarillo and salmon with coconut rice.  The skirt steak was incredibly tender and flavorful.  And I really loved the coconut rice which is almost like a risotto.

It turns into a Latin Dance Club at 10PM! I dug both vibes. Had drinks at Tall Boy and then dinner at Nacional27. The food was delicious. We started with ceviche sampler and the Nacional Platter. The ceviche is not like Peruvian ceviche! But it's still delicious. The platter was smaller and we could have done without. It was a mixture of 1 shrimp skewer, an empanada and something else. We also had the elote. THIS WAS BOMB. The corn was nicely charred and then mixed with delicious cheesy goodness. For dinner I had the gaucho served medallion with chimmichurri. This was delicious.

Being the food lover I am, I couldn't pass up all of that food for that price, and besides I could dance off a few of the added pounds after with the salsa lessons haha. So a few of us arrive and the hostess asks if we want to check our coats. We decline and sit at the bar because we have to wait for the rest of our party before we're seated. A few more folks show up and we're escorted to our seats. We sit down and are immediately greeted by the server with chips and salsa. We take a look at the regular menu and notice that some of the entrees themselves cost over 20 dollars so we instantly knew that the deal was worth it! Everyone at the table ended up ordering the 2017 special, and we each got a different entree to share with one another. The good thing about the place is that since the dance floor is in the middle of the dining area, you're free to either enjoy your food and watch others, or eat a little and dance a little as most of us did haha. All of the appetizers were really tasty, my favorite being the Lamb taco!! Nice and crunchy she'll, and the Lamb reminded me of barbacoa!

That night was a mix of salsa and bachata, so we did 30 mins of salsa and 30 mins of bachata.

My mojito wasn't bad but not the greatest. The atmosphere of this place was great. I only came during the day but the friendly staff kept encouraging me to come during night time for dance lessons.From my experience alone if I come back to Chicago I will definitely come here for dinner.,5.0,0,0,0

She was so happy with the way everything went! Grant, the hotel's director of food and beverage, went out of his way to make sure we had a lovely event. He started by giving us food recommendations for a party our size, which was really helpful. He then made sure that every last detail we requested was taken care of and that every staff member was very knowledgeable in what we wanted, which made for a very pleasant experience. When I arrived, I went up to the restaurant to make sure every thing was in line, and even the hostess knew exactly what we had requested. She graciously showed me where our party would be located and went over all the details with me just to be sure everything was right, which it was. Also, shortly after we arrived Grant checked in to make sure everything was going the way we had asked, which I greatly appreciated as well. Another thing I really appreciated about working with Grant is that he responded to my e-mails in a very timely fashion and answered all of my questions thoroughly. He truly made the planning process really easy.When we arrived, Stephanie, our server, greeted us with a warm smile and went out of her way to ensure that everyone was happy, all 21 of us! She, too, knew exactly what we wanted and made sure to deliver. She did a great job keeping a drink in everyone's hand, making sure our tables had water, clearing our plates, trying to cater to any special requests we asked of her, getting whatever we needed to aid the bride-to-be in opening her gifts, putting the cupcake toppers in the cupcakes we brought in and serving them in a very presentable fashion, etc. She definitely helped to make our experience even better! The food that Grant recommended was great! Everyone commented on how good it was. The presentation was beautiful and worked well for the setup of our party. Plus, his size/amount recommendation was pretty much perfect for our party!I had been to IO before so I knew what to expect atmosphere-wise, but many of the guests of the party had not, and they were really impressed with the scenic views of the city and lovely decor of the restaurant. I would say it's definitely one of the most beautiful places in the city to host an event!Everyone thanked me for a great party at the end, but I told them they should be thanking both Grant and Stephanie as they are the ones who really made everything perfect!",5.0,0,0,0

I've only been to Godfrey once and that was yesterday. Unfortunately I can't review the food because I didn't try any. My friend and I did get drinks here though so I can share my experience with the drinks and the overall atmosphere of the place on a Monday evening during happy hour!So the rooftop bar is located on the 4th floor of the Godfrey hotel (by the way there is pretty cute restaurant on the 1st floor! I might check that out soon!) The second you walk to the bar area all you can think is luxury; spacious, white couches, cute bar area, high rise tables, water fountain wall with Godfrey sign in the background, firepit and the view of the city!!! I personally liked that it wasn't crowded since it was a Monday. But majority of my friends have checked out Godfrey during weekends and loved it because of the crowd and that vibe. Anyways my friend and I ordered the Strawberry Mojito and the Rainbow Sangria. Both of the drinks were incredible! These two drinks weren't included in the happy hour specials so I believe we ended up paying 14 for each drink which is pretty pricey. The Sangria drink had flavored colorful ice cubes in it which I thought was pretty neat! And the Strawberry Mojito was heaven! Side note! It took me forever to finish my Strawberry Mojito drink because I was too busy talking to my Siri trying to figure out basically every single songs that was playing here! (which was a real struggle with this new iOS 11 update LOL) But I loved the playlist and if you like EDM I feel you'd love the music played here! On a Monday evening during happy hour the service was pretty good! Very attentive, friendly and answered all our questions and gave us suggestions on drinks.

Their food is good and they have great choice of drinks. The view is nice and they have a fireplace outside as well as indoor seating. But when you go there on weekends it's impossible to get in. The line is too big and there's always too many people inside. So pretty much is you got no table service it's not worth going. Drinks are bit overpriced as well. Even if you are a guest of the hotel they will only let you and plus one guest in after you stay in line at the lobby.,3.0,3,1,0

The location is on the 4th floor of hotel with a beautiful atmosphere for the city. We were welcomed by the Hostress and asked if we had reservation. We showed up early to our 11:30 reservation but that wasn't a problem. We followed her outside and wow. I had little hope for a roof-""top"" bar on the 4th floor but it was really amazing. We ordered the Bellini and Strawberry Mojito. They were both very good and fruity but not too sweet. Perfect for Brunch. Food was the Steak Benedict and Crab Benedict. The steak Benedict was two pieces of English muffin. 3 slices of steak per muffin, and one poached egg per piece. Then it was topped with Hollandaise. The Crab Benedict had a crab cake, poached egg and Hollandaise... also two pieces. We also ordered the truffle fries. The fries came out fairly quick. Crispy fries and well seasoned. It also had a side of ketchup and truffle Aioli. The Aioli was lacking a lot of flavor. It was good but you could taste the truffle much. However. I did enjoy the salty and crispy fries. It was a perfect thing to much on and they give you more than enough for 2 people. Shoot, I think it would be a perfect appetizer for like 4-6 people. Anyways, back to the main food. The steak was a little bland and lacking in salt. The hollandaise didn't have a rich buttery and salty flavor. I tried a piece of the Crab. It was good and the saltiness of the Crab helped improved the overall meal.  Overall, beautiful location. Very friendly staff and decent food.

When I asked if they could make anything with lavender, they said no and didn't even try to make some suggestions.

Overall, I'm not planning on coming back because the experience I had wasn't all that pleasant. On the top of it, they DO NOT HAVE ANY draft beer and for a beer lover like me that's a NO. Why would I pay $9 or $10 for bottle beer when I can get six packs for the same price in nearby Binny's?

You have a nice view of the river north area and there is plenty of room to move around. It was a Friday night and eventually this place turned into a club.

We wanted to sit on the large patio, and they said if we want pizza at Pizzeria Via Stato we sit on the left, and if we want other food and drinks we sit on the right at Osteria. Since the happy hour we saw online was for Osteria, we sat on the right.Once our waitress came over, I let her know we would just be doing drinks and an app (it was only 4:30). She said this side was meant for people ordering full meals, stopped, and hesitantly said she guessed it was OK if we stayed on that side since it was so early. It was a bit odd that the patio was divided, but really no big deal, and we said we could move.Now we're on the Pizzeria side, and that's when we started to get annoyed. We had to ask for the happy hour specials - they don't advertise that anywhere - and we said we were here for happy hour and might get an app. Our waiter was really trying to sell us on some food, but hey, no big deal. But the thing that really got to me was our last round we ordered right when happy hour ended and he didn't say a word about it. So when we get the check, our $5 glasses of house wine went to $9. I'm sorry, but if your waiter/waitress knows you're there just for the happy hour, I think it's simply being polite or nice to alert them that it's ending/has ended. It just felt like he was trying to get extra money out of us since we weren't ordering enough (we did end up getting an appetizer, though).I can't say much about the food.

I suggest Ubering here if you're coming for late night food. They do have a very small outdoor patio area you can eat. No wifi available. The food can occasionally be a hit or miss here. I have come here at times where the bread was hard as a rock, the beef was clearly someone scraping the bottom of the pan and giving tiny pieces of beef in the sandwich, someone dumping way too many hot peppers only in the center of the sandwich, etc. For the most part though, you can't go wrong with it.

I was here with my husband on October 31 to have a Halloween dinner. We are not party people, so we just got a table and made an order. Food is okay, the service is ridiculous. We were waiting for everything for such a long time. But the worst part is when we tried to pay. Our waitress took our debit card and disappeared. 40 minutes later we couldn't sit there anymore and my husband had to go to work early next morning, so we had to look for her all over the crowded place, but she was nowhere to be found. A security guy suggested our card might be at the bar. My husband told the barman about the situation and asked to look for a card. His first response to the situation was ""ACT LIKE A MAN""... huh?! Sorry, what?! Then the barman disappeared to look for the card. When he came back without it, he told my husband ""you card is not here, you dumb m-f***er"". I am still speechless after that happened: some bartender in a sh*thole bar allows himself to talk this way. I mean, needless to say we would never step into that place again. I've been advocating against this place among my friends and I know so many people who won't come there again after this story. This is a message to Managment, hoping they are somewhat more educated than that guy, hoping they care about the image and the reputation of this place:It is just ridiculous to treat any customers like that. We used to be frequent customers since we live next door. We brought so many profits to your place. I couldn't have imagined this would ever be the case at a recreational place downtown Chicago.

We came in at about 2 pm so it was dead; literally, we were the only people there. Nonetheless our server/bartender was super nice and attentive without being overly so. I'm pretty sure her name was Cindy? Don't quote me on that. The decor is really fun, we didn't realize that it's a nightclub as well as a restaurant. There's a bunch of flat screens, tables with taps, a list of shots on the wall, a DJ booth and a bunch of colorful skull decorations. They're my kind of people. We started with a few drinks, and both chose an Amor Azul. I have no idea what was in it but it was $12 and deliciously tart with a blue sugar coating on the glass. It was a good life choice. We ordered the elote dip ($8) as an appetizer. It was delicious. The main flavor was sweet corn which pleasantly surprised me, as I was expecting the chile and cilantro (yes, I'm one of the soapy cilantro people) to overpower it. It was really good, and would have been better at 1 am after a few rounds. For the main course, my fiancee got the Chimi ($14). She won the best meal of the table. It was massive and flavorful and coated with cheese. There was actually a photo of it advertised on the flat screens at some point, and her plate looked identical to the promo photo. The chicken was moist and well-seasoned, and everything went together great. I got the Tres Taco Especial, which is any three tacos from the menu for $15 dollars. I chose the duck carnitas, beef cheek, and at the recommendation of our waitress, negro modelo battered cod. The duck carnitas was okay, but the meat itself didn't have a lot of flavor. Plus, I found two pretty decent sized bones. It happens, but it's not ideal in a hand food situation for sure. The beef cheek was delicious. The slaw and pickled onions cut the richness of the meat nicely. The meat was tender and melted in my mouth, and had just a tiny bit of heat. My favorite of the three was the battered cod, which tasted fresh and had a good amount of texture from the softness of the fish and the crunch of the cabbage. I was glad I had that one last.Our server was great and made conversation with us throughout our meal. She was friendly and funny, and gave us cards for a free drink and a free taco the next time we come in. I don't know why I waited so long to come here, but I'm glad it's on my radar. I'd go later in the evening if I went again so we had some company. It's reasonably priced with decent portions and a good atmosphere and great service. I'm sure we'll be back again, and probably soon. The fiancee won't stop talking about the chimichanga.",5.0,1,1,1

I've been meaning to check out Celeste ever since I read that the FLOTUS loved their chicken so much that 30 orders were delivered to Air Force One during one of their trips here. Even the pictures posted make the chicken look scrumptious! The service was fine. Not great but not as bad as some other reviewers experienced. The place is still beautiful but I did not go upstairs. Back to the food. The chicken was extra juicy and the pieces were large. Also scarily large. The batter was nice and crispy, but overall the chicken lacked flavor. I just wish they would've put some salt and pepper or something on the chicken before they fried it. The hot size on the side was good but didn't make up for lack of seasoning. We also ordered the kale Caesar salad and grilled octopus to round out the meal. The salad was good, but perhaps too much dressing. See picture. The octopus was ok. I hesitate to say terrible because it was cooked properly at least. But it didn't look grilled and nothing like the octopus in other pictures. It clearly is a different preparation now, but I would have liked more for $16. I don't think I will be returning any time soon. My friend had a drink at the bar before I arrived, and she loved it.

I came here for a friend's 30th birthday last month and it was a mess. The server seemed to be slightly drunk (she took a shot with my bday friend), even though she was sweet. She said she couldn't split checks, even though we were at several different tables, which seemed weird. We were basically two separate parties, so why each table couldn't be it's own check, I don't understand. We weren't even that large of a group -- we had two tables and six people at each. She ended up forgetting to put in three orders from my table, and the manager came over and took care of it an hour after everyone else got their food (I think he comped those meals and maybe more from the group, though I'm not sure how it played out since I didn't order food and left before they were done. After the no splitting checks thing, I just ordered my drinks directly from the bar). He did apologize for the server, though it was weird the way he did it (he said she was usually one of their best but had received some bad news earlier that day...it seemed oddly personal to be saying something like that to a large group of people). I do think it's fair that they comped the meals, at least, so I appreciate that. The food and drinks were okay, but like everything in River North, it's so overpriced.

We tried the newer Marina City location since it's closer to the theater we always go to, but had some less-than stellar experiences so we started coming back here (plus this one's larger).  I've always had good meals here, some better than others but never a bad experience.  The tiramisu pancakes were to die for, sweet but not too sweet, and I've had the eggs benedict on multiple occasions and enjoyed them.This place will easily split checks for you, which is great (another thing we struggled with at the Marina City locale).  For smaller groups you can use the NoWait app to put your name in ahead of time, which is great and I highly recommend.Two downsides: it gets loud in there (you can still carry on a conversation, but if you're talking to someone more than right next to you you'll have to speak up a bit), and there's not a large waiting area (though that's common for many popular brunch places, they'd rather have room for tables).  On a busy day there will be people waiting outside, which isn't great in the winter.  Overall, though, those are minor and considering how great they've always been otherwise, we plan to keep coming back!",5.0,1,1,1

This location is right on the Chicago River, you can eat inside or outside.

They have a happy hour with great food and drink items, for example, pickle chips $3.00! The food was good and the portions generous. They  describe the menu off the board and have chicken, fish, ribs, seafood and a nice selection of sides. The desserts are made in house and the cheesecake is delicious!

Unfortunately, being as jet lagged tired as I was, I was instead forced to assume that the hostess and everyone else there were definitely on a shitty low level of human life and my girlfriend and I would most likely end up with all kinds of spit, bugs, and everything else in our food and beers. So here's my advise to the manager. Make 100% certain that people walking into your establishment have the slightest clue where they are and just what the hell they are in for, so that they can decide wether or not they're going to enjoy such a crappy and random way of being treated when they are there spending their hard earned dollars.",3.0,7,1,0

I went here specifically because I wanted a meat pizza and they had the best combination for me. The food: I had a small Meaty Legend with onions added and yum! The combination of sausage, pepperoni, Canadian Bacon, and bacon added a nice level of saltiness and gave a pop of flavor. I dislike most pizzas because of the lack of flavor. Adding salt and Parmesan generally helps, but you don't need to do that for the Meaty Legend. I have to add onions too for texture. The combination of meat, cheese, and onions are a textural delight. I don't generally like a thicker crust and tend not to eat the crust, because the crust really is just a transport vehicle for the toppings. But the crust here is so buttery and had a nice crunchy texture, I did eat it. All of it. The service: I sat at the bar. It always amazes me when a bartender gives bad service considering how many choices we have here. Adam the bartender was amazing. He was attentive without being intrusive. Took the time to go over the food and drink specials. Also took the time to have a conversation with me. You definitely can tell the difference between a bartender who likes people and one who doesn't. I did have to laugh when he mentioned how much pizza I ate. Honestly to know me is to comment on how much I eat. I love food, and I embrace that wholeheartedly. Happy Hour: Their happy hour runs from 3-6, which I thought was very generous. I believe they had $3 Gino's tap beer and $5 house wine. I'm not really a beer person but I took a picture of their tappers.

Our waiter suggested getting an appetizer as he warned that the deep dish could take 45-1 hour to prepare. We placed our order for garlic bread and chose a small deep dish, half chicago fire style and combo. We received our appetizer which was good. After some time, we saw that other tables were receiving their pizzas before us.. we thought maybe they ordered the thin crust which wouldn't take as long as the deep dish but nope, they had a deep dish. After 3 other tables got their deep dish, we inquired about ours and our waiter said something a long the lines of yeah.. i don't know why yours is taking so long. And he went to check on it. He came back a few minutes later with our pizza.That experience made it feel like they don't care about when orders were being placed and just made the pizzas whenever they saw fit.

While the food and beer isn't bad here, they're unfortunately competing against the other great pizza establishments nearby. The ability to write on the wall and the casual vibe don't really make up for the lack of a signature flavor here. The beer flight I tried lacked any distinct flavors or aromas that would help me distinguish it from other flights offered by local breweries. The pizza looked great and had a ton of juice from the fresh tomatoes, but flavorwise was underwhelming. While toppings such as bacon and cherry tomatoes were of generally good quality, I found that the excessive amounts of sweet tomato sauce completely covered up the flavors of the toppings. The amount of cheese in the deep dish was alright, but it didn't really have a nice gooey texture like you'd find in a Giordano's pizza. Finally, the crust was fluffy and ""bready"" but lacked any distinguishing flavor like Pequod's caramelization or Lou Malnati's crispy butter crust.

Untitled provides that, and quite a bit more with burlesque dancers, in a refined, classic venue. I came with a group of 5 on a Friday evening, so a seat was hard to come by. No problems! We just waltzed our way to the back near the bar, where we stood around a circular table, enjoying the jazz/rock/soul/RnB mix that the band on the nearby stage was playing. I can't comment on the drinks or food unfortunately, but I'd guess they were more than passable considering the packed house that Untitled had that night. I'd certainly say that Untitled hosts a more mature crowd of people, as we seemed to be the youngest in the house that night. I really enjoyed my time here, even though I was mostly just taking in the vibe and atmosphere. After all, good setting + good company = good time; just make sure you're taking the right people though.",4.0,0,0,0

The salad.... grit in the radish round. I make better salads at home. Too much dressing and thanks for the choice!The oysters..... not bad. The ""ribeye"". Apparently we weren't served a whole steak nor did we get to have it cooked at the temperature that we prefer. Really? Even Burger King allows us to have it our way. The steak was so rare that it was inedible. The sauce on top tasted like it actually contained dirty dishwater.  The broccolini tasted as bitter as collard greens and the fingerling potatoes were undercooked. Where were we, a banquet hall?  Super disappointing. My coworkers who ordered salmon reported how overdone it was. Add this to the fact that really tried to cram all of us at a few tables shoved together while there were plenty of tables open...it was just weird.The decor was opulent. Bathroom attendants offered whatever would make you happy.  There was a cool bar with a wall of whiskey. The giant screen showed the old movie Rear Window.

We stopped by here on a Friday night for dinner and were surprised with how much charm this spot has. Think old school Chicago steakhouse meets hearty Italian. While we were initially seated along the wall where the heat vents were blasting (literally would be uncomfortable to enjoy a meal as you felt like you were baking in an oven), we had the host move us to a central table where it was much more comfortable. Will say this spot was pretty busy as it was Friday night prime time, but no issues with service promptness. Eventually decided on the seafood linguine (frutti di mare). Although it was close to $30 for the plate, I will say it was definitely large enough to share between two and has generous portion of fresh fish, clams, mussels, and squid. Hearty and delicious all around. I also recall starting with a salad which was great with the fresh cracked pepper.Anyways, definitely a great spot for groups or even for a date night.

The place has a nice terrace by the Chicago river that is pretty sweet in the summertime. The interior is like many a steakhouse- dark, brass trimmings at the bar and on the dividers, dark leather- so no big differentiation. I had a bone-in strip loin steak, medium rare. Quite good and juicy. Humongous size. Steaks come with a side of salad and fries which are really crispy and good. The downside is there is no option to substitute them for something more nutritious or healthy if you feel so inclined, so you have to order a side and let the fries cool and go to waste. At the prices they charge (~$52 for a steak or chops!), I believe they could afford to substitute the fries for asparagus (which are not costly) or some other alternative (corn, onions, spinach,...). Service is not bad but they lack a personal touch and a little more attentiveness (my wife finished her entreé and the server never offered another glass of wine).All in all, it was a good meal and I am not about to complain.  Far from it- I quite enjoyed it. Just that at the steep prices they charge, I would rather go to Morton's if I feel like a good steak- plus the service there is just sterling. So, on balance, I would recommend considering the above if you're in the mood for a good steak as I believe you get a better steak for your buck. Sorry, Erie Café- I liked it but I believe the price was too high or the overall flavor of the steak needs to improve even more if this is to be considered a real alternative to some of the other choices.",3.0,1,0,0

On their website I found that they suggested I use the ""No Wait"" app to check wait times. At 8am, it showed no wait. Out of curiosity, I checked Wildberry and it was 40 to 60 minutes, which seems to be the usual. We walked the short distance to the restaurant and walked up the short flight of stairs to be greeted by fun and sassy signage and a contemporary restaurant entrance with a bright yellow clever, fun logo for their name. We were told it would be 5 to 10 minutes but ended up being seated in only a minute. The restaurant was pretty small but had a bright, modern atmosphere and no wait, so that's a plus!They had fewer menu options but all sounded just as delicious as Wildberry. I wanted to try a normal breakfast with eggs, bacon and the likes but the Cinnamon French toast called to me since it was made from an actual cinnamon roll and cooked like French toast. It didn't disappoint and may have been better than the cinnamon French toast at Wildberry just because it was a more interesting concept! They also served soups, salads and sandwiches if you wanted something other than breakfast. Again, we all ordered something different and allowed samples to go around so I tried the red velvet French toast (oh wow!!!) and banana blue crunch cake pancakes that my friend ordered which both came in a smaller version than the breakfast serving. My boyfriend ordered the All-Star Combo which served eggs, Choice of Crepes or French toast, bacon, and sausage that was as big as hot dogs! I didn't try my friend's omelet but it looked delicious along with the side of seasoned potatoes. I ordered a rishi hot green tea to add a little something healthy to my morning, haha!

Haha so not a real complaint but I wish it was open till like 6 that be ideal for my personal life hahaha. 2nd complaint: bulletproof smoothie, I was so excited when I saw this on the menu bc I am following a bulletproof diet/keto and I love smoothies but those tend to not be keto. Anyways the bulletproof smoothie has Bananas in it, which is not bulletproof. Bananas are not bulletproof or keto so that's sucks, so I feel like they shouldn't call it bulletproof, it's miss leading. If you don't follow that diet the smoothie is prob pretty good, hopefully they can replace the banana with something else that is bulletproof.

I will say that both the steak and the shrimp were good, as were the soft, fresh tortillas and their salsa verde. You have have either authentic with cilantro and onions, or American-style with lettuce, tomatoes and cheese. The shrimp was actually better than I thought it would be, and the amount filled up the small tortilla. And I loved their guacamole! It's made to order just the way I like it, with the right amount cilantro, onions and garlic. Yum.

I'm pretty sure her name was Cindy? Don't quote me on that. The decor is really fun, we didn't realize that it's a nightclub as well as a restaurant. There's a bunch of flat screens, tables with taps, a list of shots on the wall, a DJ booth and a bunch of colorful skull decorations. They're my kind of people. We started with a few drinks, and both chose an Amor Azul. I have no idea what was in it but it was $12 and deliciously tart with a blue sugar coating on the glass. It was a good life choice. We ordered the elote dip ($8) as an appetizer. It was delicious. The main flavor was sweet corn which pleasantly surprised me, as I was expecting the chile and cilantro (yes, I'm one of the soapy cilantro people) to overpower it. It was really good, and would have been better at 1 am after a few rounds. For the main course, my fiancee got the Chimi ($14). She won the best meal of the table. It was massive and flavorful and coated with cheese. There was actually a photo of it advertised on the flat screens at some point, and her plate looked identical to the promo photo. The chicken was moist and well-seasoned, and everything went together great. I got the Tres Taco Especial, which is any three tacos from the menu for $15 dollars. I chose the duck carnitas, beef cheek, and at the recommendation of our waitress, negro modelo battered cod. The duck carnitas was okay, but the meat itself didn't have a lot of flavor. Plus, I found two pretty decent sized bones. It happens, but it's not ideal in a hand food situation for sure. The beef cheek was delicious. The slaw and pickled onions cut the richness of the meat nicely. The meat was tender and melted in my mouth, and had just a tiny bit of heat. My favorite of the three was the battered cod, which tasted fresh and had a good amount of texture from the softness of the fish and the crunch of the cabbage. I was glad I had that one last.Our server was great and made conversation with us throughout our meal. She was friendly and funny, and gave us cards for a free drink and a free taco the next time we come in. I don't know why I waited so long to come here, but I'm glad it's on my radar. I'd go later in the evening if I went again so we had some company. It's reasonably priced with decent portions and a good atmosphere and great service. I'm sure we'll be back again, and probably soon. The fiancee won't stop talking about the chimichanga.",5.0,1,1,1

The table got a few tacos (fried avocado, chicken, carne asada), quesadilla, chicken tortilla soup and the chips and guacamole. We also had an assortment of beverages as well, the mamacita, IPA's and coffees.  All were very tasty and very big portions.

I really liked the food, and the service was good.I was a bit hesitant to try this place because of its reputation as a noisy dive bar and a jam packed disco. But that's at night. At lunch time it's just a Mexican restaurant. It was still noisy on my first visit, but the place was empty on a Friday at lunch during my second visit.The nachos are a very generous pile of just about everything you've ever seen on nachos. The underlying chips are thin and crispy, and the only fault I found was the use of liquid cheese rather than melting real cheese under a broiler.The guacamole and chips are also a very generous serving (and were free, because of a yelp check-in. Deal!)I really liked the two tacos I had: pastor, and crispy fish. Both were on small single tortillas and piled high, so you have to eat at least half before you can pick them up.My companion said the quesadilla was one of the best she's had, and since she makes the best quesadilla I've ever had, that was high praise.The margaritas are served in a 20-ounce glass, but they're more than half ice cubes.Service was friendly and efficient.",4.0,4,4,2

Drinks are definitely worth it!! But food (tacos) are not so great. I ordered the Al Pastor and Steak Tacos. The food came out lukewarm and the al pastor were not good at all. If you've been to Federales or Big Star tacos you will be very disappointed by thier AL Pastor tacos. Our waitress (Kristi -she was very nice!) was nice enough to let me send the Al Pastor back.

Honestly I would give a restaurant that failed 2 back to back health inspections a second chance before going back to this rude ass establishment. I ate here today. My friend had her birthday celebration. This was my first time trying this place. Let me just point out when you read reviews if the reviewer has 1 or 2 reviews and they are bad take that with a grain of salt. That reviewer probably just signed up for Yelp just to write a bad review. Look at my reviews. They are compiled of good, bad, and mediocre. My point is to address the authenticity of this review. This place gets 2 stars because the food is cool. The service, however, is TERRIBLE. If you find several rude employees in a business it's a culture. My friends and I went around 2:00. Apparently they have a day party here that starts around 4 or so, but when we arrived it was empty. The bartender was selective with who she assisted. I felt like my friends and I were being racially profiled. She wasn't attentive at all. We ordered from the bar until the birthday girl arrived, and our table was ready. We had a different server who was also rude. She was annoyed by the fact that we originally ordered food and drinks from the bar. We closed out our tab there though. I asked her for condiments and water. She didn't even want to assist me. She said that I needed to go to the bar. I get that the stuff I was asking for was free, but I had every intention on buying more drinks. Later my sister asked her to take a picture for our table she literally rolled her eyes.

If the line that crawls all the way up the stairs doesn't give this away, the baller salads they make will certainly convince you!

With an hour time slot for lunch, I've never had a problem getting back to the office on time. Don't let that line scare you! Every time I visit I opt to build my own salad. These salads are huge and super filling given the large assortment of toppings they offer. They have everything from fruits and veggies to a large variety of proteins including nuts, salmon, chicken, tofu, tuna, steak, etc. I usually get a salad with a mixture of all their green options (romaine, spinach, etc.) and toppings such as cucumber, corn, onion, black beans, cilantro, carrots, edamame, tomatoes, avocado, and feta cheese. They also have more dressings to choose from than any other places I've been to in the Windy City. My favorites included the jalapeno ranch and the honey mustard emulsion! With every salad order you also get a piece of pita, which is great for scooping up the salad. There is plenty of seating to choose from, my favorite spot was this giant round table in the back right hand corner. The line to order sort of winds through the seating so depending on where you decide to plop down, it may feel a little crowded. That's why I always liked sitting in this little back nook.

Angela S. and I browsed our options and landed at Billy Goat when we decided it was best to warm up our winter day with some comfort food. I ordered the special that was posted: Cheeseburger & fries for $4.99. No bad, not bad at all. My order was ready super quick! They had me put on my own toppings before they wrapped it up to go. Options included pickles, tomatoes, onions, relish, and your standard condiments.To me, the cheeseburger was just okay. Perfect for the occasion, but if I'm comparing cheeseburgers I've had in my life, this one's patty was way too thin and between way too much bun. The fries were pretty good (not the best I've ever had, but still yummy) and the portion I got was huge!At the end of the day, Billy Goat got the job done. Cheap and convenient comfort food provided with quick, friendly and efficient service.Pro tip:The Mediterranean line next door was extremely long, so if you aren't counting cals and in a rush - head to Billy Goat! Fun fact:They also offer breakfast!",3.0,5,2,1

LA Burdick opened just this week and my friend invited me to a private tasting. We were greeted by Ted, who I believe is the owner, and he walked us through the company's background and their products. They don't have a freezer, they don't use preservatives, they have a few gluten free products AND they make their bonbons by hand. Their chocolate only lasts for two weeks and so whatever they don't sell they donate to local schools, how amazing is that?!We were able to sample bonbons, drinking chocolate and a couple pastries. I tried the dark drinking chocolate, hazelnut orange cake, earl grey chocolate, white drinking chocolate and mocha cake. It was a lot of chocolate but everything was such high quality! Drinking chocolate was NOT hot cocoa. They grate up their chocolate into little nib sized pieces and melt it with warm milk. It literally felt like I was drinking warm, rich chocolate! I personally enjoyed the white chocolate one the best. The hazelnut orange cake was such a perfect blend of hazelnut and orange. If you don't think orange and chocolate flavor, you'd be surprised by how well they execute this combo! The mocha cake tasted exactly like tiramisu but a more firm consistency. By the time I made it to earl grey chocolate I was starting to get overloaded on the chocolate flavor to fully enjoy it. I think it was good but my taste buds were definitely impaired by this point.Overall: this place is super cute.

I ordered a kale salad and asked for chicken, to which the waitress asked if I wanted smoked or grilled and I answered grilled. About an hour later we finally got our food. The salad was actually really good, but the annoyance grew worse when we got the bill. On the menu the kale salad is $11 and chicken $4 but my salad was $18?????? How? So I asked the waitress to clarify and I showed her the menu. She came back 10 minutes later and told me that the grilled chicken is more than the smoked.... excuse me? $3 more than smoked chicken? From the grill? Not to mention the waitress never told me that when she offered it. I figured they would be the same price. She nor the manager thought to do anything about it despite the fact that it was wrong and that our restaurant visit took 2 hours. Won't be going there EVER AGAIN!",1.0,0,0,0

There was a bit of a crowd, waiting to be seated, but the restaurant itself was pretty empty. We had booked a reservation via open table and when we checked in with the host, I guess they did not process our check in. When you walk into the main dining room, it is incredibly spacious, peaked ceilings line with plaque of blues artists in soft blue lighting, and a small performance stage. We loved that there was live music, performed by Keithen Banks. We were seated at a high top table. It's pretty solid seating, you get a great view of the stage, my only complaint is that it was close to impossible to read the menu due to zero lighting. We had thought it was because our eyes had not adjusted to the room, but I mean, it was pretty dark out when we walked in. Our server ( Aria) was awesome. She was super attentive, made excellent recommendations,and she explained how the ""pass the line"" tickets worked. My husband ordered the HOB burger with provolone cheese and I went with the Brisket Sandwich. The HOB burger was a decent size, meat was grilled nicely, and well seasoned. My Brisket Sandwich was huge. The meat was tender, good meat to fat ratio, but I had an issue with how it was drenched in BBQ sauce. Which in my opinion took away from the flavor of the meat. Both sandwiches came with French fries,  sliced pickles, and ketchup on the side. We weren't a fan of the fries. It was nothing impressive. For the burger, you had to ask for mustard. Which was weird because isn't mustard a burger staple?",3.0,3,1,0

Let me tell you this place as not change since in forever. The décor is still impeccable.  The music playing throughout the restaurant was very enjoyable.I like the great comfortable vibes and laid back atmosphere. Our waiter was very attentive and made sure that we had all the essentials that we needed to enjoy our dining experience. We both ordered the blacked chicken breast which came with Cole Slaw and fries. The chicken was a little too spicy. I think the chef got a little too heavy handed on the Cajun spice. It was just too much that it over powered the flavor. The HB is a nice touristy place to come and hang out and enjoy with family or friends..,4.0,1,0,0

""we don't brew decaf on the weekend"" was the response. How about a decaf espresso drink, then? ""We don't have decaf espresso."" Kind of a bummer...The selection of baked goods was nice. Several types of breads - both sweet and savory - and various pastries. The banana bread was moist and had a nice flavor. I ordered the special -  Huevos rancheros.

Eggs on waffles with a tablespoon of black beans, Pico de Gallo,  and guacamole. While the dish had a nice flavor, it was somewhat dry. The waffles needed something to add some moisture to the dish... not sure what, I'm not a chef!, but something. Would I go back? Yeah, probably. Give it a try - it was busy so I imagine that their food is probably pretty good overall.",3.0,0,0,0

We talked with them while waiting to get in, EXTREMELY nice anf pleaseant. The bouncer denied them and when asked why the bouncer said. ""Yall some goofy terrorist looking motha fuckers. I aint trying to get blownt up."" 2nd incident:While at the bar the cook came out and ran us our food, the cook asked the manager if he could take a 5 minute smoke. The place was empty besides us and a group of 7. We heard the cook say he was done with his tickets and he will be quick. The manager responded back with ""get your fat white ass back in the kitchen"" the cook responded with he has been here for 7 & 1/2 hours without a break which is illegal and morally fucked up to treat your workers like that. I was pissed about this personally since I am a big advocate for workers rights. 3rd incident: The group of 7 was six dudes and one girl. The girl was blacked out drunk in the both. Four of them went outside to smoke and left the girl and one guy to ""look after her!"" His idea of looking out for her was to groupe her breasts while licking and kissing all over here face and neck. Remember this girl was black out drunk. When I seen it I immediately went to the bouncer to have him stop it. Instead of stopping it he said ""Shut up whitey, I bet you one of those nosey rich white boys. Mind your own fucking business and let dude get some pussy."" I asked to speak to the manager, he said ""fuck off"" and walked away. I turned and approached the man who was contiuning to do this.

When we approached the bouncer to get further insight on the situation, he became very nasty and aggressive. We asked if we could speak with the manager, and he snarkily replied that he ""was"" the manager. While we were standing there, we saw not one but two white people enter with distressed jeans (one male and one female).

I came to Boss Bar tonight with friends who have frequented this place often. We were having a good night until I went and used your women's restroom. I went in the first stall in the bathroom that was empty and right away sat down and started to do my thing. At the same time I felt pain. Reaching for toilet paper I felt my finger get cut. I stood up from the toilet and quickly got dressed while my thighs were stinging and my finger was dripping blood down my hand. I didn't even bother to stop and try and wash my hands and I went up the stairs to find a manager. I was beyond upset. My thighs and leggings were covered in shards of glass and my finger was gushing from a cut from glass as well. All from sitting on toilet and reaching for toilet paper. The whole entire stall had glass on toilet seat, dispenser and floor. I went upstairs and went to the bar and asked to speak to the manager. I was told the person I was talking to was the manager. He handed me an antiseptic wipe and that was it. I was shocked and didn't believe this could possibly be the manager, which I later found out was the owner of this bar. I told him that there was no way he was a manager because he literally had nothing to do or say besides handing me a wipe. He had no concern for what happened or the state of his restrooms. I left because he wouldn't help me more than that and I was hoping there would be someone else that would. I walked to the front of the bar and went outside to speak to the door men since my friends know them and were allowed to skip the line into the bar because of them. I asked them if they could help me find someone to talk to that could help me. A man who's name I still don't know took me inside. He was wearing beanie and was not the main door guy. He said that was the owner I talked to and I said there has to be someone else that will do something besides handing me an antiseptic wipe seeing as I was BLEEDING, my legs had glass in them and I was visibly upset. The man said there is nothing they can do for me. I told them if that is what I'm getting, a wipe, and no one to write a report or ANYTHING, that I would not let this go as that bathroom stall was beyond dangerous. The front door man then said to me "" you don't have enough money to do anything."" He then walked away and then left me standing in the entry way of the bar. My friend then found me and asked me what happened. I told her and then she then went and found the door man and told him that I was her friend and that what happened was not ok. He then proceeded to get security, told my friend I was crazy and not well and that I needed to go. He brought us outside of the bar and another bouncer said we can call an ambulance. I said I did not need an ambulance as I was able to function and knew I wasn't on the verge of death. I didn't need an ambulance to confirm my finger was cut and bleeding and that my leggings had glass in them. After my friend explained to them how bad this would make them look, he told security to go and brought us to their employee bathroom. He brought me yet another antiseptic wipe and a bandaid and then left. I shook out my leggings in the bathroom, cleaned up my hand and thought the night could go on despite how upset I was with the whole situation. I went back to sit at the bar as this was apart of another friends going away party. My roommate got wind about what happened and he confronted the owner/manager. He said that he told me he could call an ambulance WHICH HE DID NOT. His bouncer and front door man did much later after this happened. He then told him that we had pictures of everything and that we weren't going to just let this go. We went back to our friends. The same front door man then found us and came up to us and asked to speak to us. At this point we had already been grabbing our bill, leaving our friends because we wanted no more to do with this horrible, disgusting establishment. I paid my bill and we walked outside with the front door guy and he just walked away never saying another word.I want every woman and man to know that going to this bar..do not expect to be treated with respect. I asked for help from MULTIPLE people working at this place and was told I don't have enough money Incase I want to go after them for their disregard for customers safety,.. they tell you your crazy because your upset because your lower half of your clothes has mini shards of glass in it and your bleeding.

One should probably know better than to assume that a bar named ""The Boss Bar"" would oppose this behavior. Everyone on this level of the bar witnessed and stood in shock as the employees did nothing -- the assault lasted for at least ten minutes. The man (late 30s, Caucasian, blond, bulgy blue eyes, blue striped shirt, slim build) was confronted by a patron and got hostile and threatening immediately, triggering the patron to call the police. He claimed that the incapacitated women, who he was simultaneously groping, was actually friends with a bartender currently on staff. He was coherent and clear-eyed; he did not appear drunk. The bartenders did nothing about the situation. When an ambulance came, the bouncer bragged, ""They already left together,"" knowing exactly for whom 911 was called. He berated the 911 caller and briefly attempted to prevent the emergency workers from entering The Boss Bar. I was fortunate enough to have two white males who were right next to the victim the whole time laugh and mansplain that, ""That's what having a good time looks like!"" despite being aware that the man was not drunk. They confirmed they saw the man walk her out of the bar. They also claimed, ""We wouldn't do nothing if we saw someone in need of help."" Finally, although they agreed that she was incapacitated and therefore could not provide consent, they did not think there was cause for concern that she would be taken advantage of after the man maneuvered her out of the bar. If somehow this woman was not drugged but was actually this drunk by 9:20pm to the point of incapacitation, then the bar, bartenders, and the bartender ""friend"" are directly responsible for whatever is currently happening to this victim. If she was drugged, which seemed to be the case, then the bar, bartenders, and the bartender ""friend"" are at best still complicit. I am appalled that the bouncer berated the 911-caller and bragged to the emergency workers that he enabled the man to, by definition, kidnap an incapacitated woman. I am (unfortunately) not surprised whatsoever by the vacuousness and the superciliousness of the two privileged white males, who are virtually guaranteed to never be molested while incapacitated on a bar.I am sick about this. If the emergency workers called to the situation truly did not arrive in time to assist --as the bouncer and two white males claimed--, then I hope bringing awareness to the reprehensibility of The Boss Bar prevents others from going and from therefore being violated on the bar if not worse.

This is the perfect place for a guy's night out, for a bachelorette party to get things started and for those celebratory moments after work that warrant a cocktail with colleagues. The space is huge and seems as though it was recently refurbished with a vintage pub theme. Everything from the coil light BOSS BAR sign (pictured) that illuminates Clark & Hubbard avenues to the black & white photos of speakeasies and gangsters showcase Chicago's earlier years. Great variety of beers and cocktails at an awesome value. You'll be pleasantly surprised when you get your bill after ordering a few 16-ounce draft, Lagunitas IPAs and discover that you don't even have to break your $20 bill. Many of Chicago's downtown nightlife scenes charge twice as much than your neighborhood bar, but Boss Bar Chicago isn't going to set you as far back as the tourist traps. The bar staff is among the most gorgeous, friendly, efficient and fastest teams that I have ever seen or been a part of. History has shown me time and time again how the ""bomb-shell"" waitresses or bartenders in some establishments will spend most of their energy and personality at the end of the bar or with the tables where the high rollers are seated. Well, not at Boss Bar. These girls are great. They have a nonstop sense of urgency to serve every thirsty patron as quickly as possible. They work together seamlessly when groups have a tab and do a great job of communicating together. These added layers of skills, experience and openness to make themselves available to everyone prove that there beauty is not only skin deep...especially in the cases of Evelyn & Ashley (pictured).Certainly dress to impress to feel the most comfortable at Boss Bar on Friday and Saturday nights. However, come as you are because I've witnessed many couples in business casual and comfy sightseeing attire permitted to enter as they seemingly were about to stroll past the entrance. As for the ladies, that seems to be a whole different story. Most of the women at Boss Bar appear to have spared no expense on how lovely they look. Many appear to be dressed for a wedding reception or their company's soiree while other appear in serious pursuit of finding a man. As a bachelor, a spectator and, of course, a gentleman, I'll admit that it is a lot of fun talking, dancing and sometimes just watching these eye-catching ladies in high spirits from all walks of life.All in all, I recommend that you and/or your group be the most comfortable versions of yourselves and let Boss Bar with its lively crowd, games and brilliant bar staff do the rest of the work in creating a night you won't want to forget.

Up until recently I worked out of the Merchandise Mart and would travel down stairs to the second floor for breakfast and lunch at least once a week. Protein Bar was a regular spot for me for multiple reasons. Number one, they are super quick at taking order and getting food out to their customers. There could be a line out the door and you can still get through the line rather quickly. I would say 99% of the time I was in and out of there in less than twenty minutes. Secondly, their food is healthy and very tasty. I've tried several different items off their lunch and breakfast menus and I have never been disappointed. When it comes to breakfast their sunrise spinach and pesto is my absolute favorite! Scrambled eggs, flavorful basil pesto, fresh spinach, and one of my favorite cheeses, parmesan! You seriously can't go wrong. Now on to lunch... They have great wraps and you always have the position to substitute the protein for their tofu. This makes vegetarian life easy peasy! Another go-to for me is their South A'Caid smoothly. Oh my goodness, this is life! Fresh Acai berry, banana, blueberry, greek yogurt, vanilla protein, and almost milk. It's so freakin' good and packed with protein. Just be aware of the high calorie count. Lastly, the staff here is always so fun.

It's more like ""filler"". My salad had very little dark leafy greens and mainly crappy iceberg lettuce. Protein Bar needs to step up their lettuce game because paying $10 for a salad that barely has any solid greens isn't worth it.Note: I let one of the employees know that the salad was primarily iceberg lettuce.

And both sandwiches are a very good thing. The ingredients are quality, and I absolutely love how great I feel afterwards. There's no sluggish feeling in the bottom of your stomach because the ingredients are all so fresh and healthy. But over the years, things have definitely changed at Hannah's Bretzel. The salt & pepper potato chips now come in an official, sealed bag instead of the paper sleeves. Thankfully, they're still just as good! And the ingredients are used a little more sparingly on the sandwiches, which makes me sad. But perhaps the biggest change is with the gluten free bread -- Hannah's Bretzel JUST switched to using a new gluten free pretzel bread from Wheat's End. Recently, I ordered for pick-up, got home and saw the bread, and majorly freaked out, thinking I'd accidentally been given the regular sandwich bread. I called the location (like, four times) to ask if they'd switched things up but they didn't answer. Not wanting to have an allergic reaction, I drove the 20 minutes back to ask. A manager saw I'd returned with the sandwich and explained that yep, they started using a new gluten free bread just over a month ago! And that's awesome -- I just wish someone had told me! Now, the gluten free bread now has two slices on the top; the regular pretzel bread has three. It's pretty amazing how it actually tastes and smells just like real pretzel bread.

The combination of a fresh-cooked (literally right in front of you) egg, with high quality nitrate-free bacon, with a very sharp tasting white cheddar cheese, all in between an absolutely amazing pretzel roll, was epic, to say the very least.The only things I was a little disappointed in were the size and the price of the sandwich. It was pretty small, almost ""slider""-sized and cost me over $4 after tax.  Don't get me wrong, this is River North and one shouldn't usually be afraid to pay at least $10 for a meal at almost anywhere here. That said, at $4, I wasn't quite full after this sandwich, but I can definitely appreciate the quality of what Hannah's Bretzel is cooking up.Speaking of quality, this is precisely what the sandwich was. Hannah's Bretzel very clearly and accurately advertises the use of natural, sometimes organic, sustainable, environmentally-friendly, etc, types of products/business practices at its stores.

It would have been great by itself, but in honesty it made the sandwich pretty impossible to eat. Their roll is also hearty and tasty, but it was really difficult to bite into, and I know this sounds weird, but the top of the bread isn't flat and every bite ended up being at a weird angle and tricky to maneuver - ha! I know it sounds ridiculous, but I have to admit to getting more of the sandwich outside of my mouth. Next time I'm getting it on a pretzel roll. I would definitely order this same sandwich again. Just pretty small...and for the price...I was a bit taken back, but it's the city.Overall, the menu is large and everything looked great. They even offer special breakfast dishes. The  shelf with all the chocolates was super tempting, and now I'm kicking myself for not purchasing. This was a hard review to write, because I like everything the place stands for, but I just didn't have a good eating experience. Lovely and fresh. Clean design. Serious cool factor.

Now it just needs to get with the times because there are too many options in the neighborhood to walk over to. The Walmart express around the corner has everything, the Walgreens has liquor again and Trader Joes isn't that far from here either. So when I say this place needs a facelift, I really mean it. It needs to move into the future. They have liquor here, lunch meat, crackers and a grill for fresh food. It just feels dark and in uncheerful in here. My biggest complaint is about the grill exhaust system here! Either it doesn't work or they don't turn it on. My biggest pet peve is leaving a restaurant and smelling like the restaurant. On my last visit I was buying a few things and I ended up smelling like a dirty greasy grill. Honestly I smelled like I worked 12 hours at an all night diner. If I walk into a store for 5 minutes to buy groceries, then I don't expect to stink when I leave. So be warned if your on your way to that million dollar deal and you need to buy gum, please don't buy the gum here. Your client will start wondering if you grabbed a cheeseburger before the meeting.

For the price, Leghorn has really seemed to drop in quality, and that's a shame.I will give them props for handling Chicago's River Dyeing super well, and giving us a safe haven to refuel.

With that said, I feel like their service has deteriorated SIGNIFICANTLY over the past six months. I want to be clear that I love their food and have never had a bad experience food-wise, but the service is nearly enough to turn me off of ABP altogether. If there was a similar breakfast spot in the Mart, I probably would have stopped going there already.I usually stop in on my way the office, typically around 9 am. The morning rush has usually died down by that point, so I don't have to wait long to order my bagel. Here is where the first problem ensues. On numerous occasions, I have waited at the counter for a ridiculous amount of time - while the employees are standing there - for someone to acknowledge me and take my order. I realize they may be busy at the moment, which is understandable. However, zero acknowledgement of the customer is not. Considering the fact that there seems to be twenty people working at the same time every time I step foot in ABP,  someone should be there to greet the customer - especially when it's not busy. Most of the time, the employees seem to be more interested in yelling across the restaurant to each other and discussing their plans after work than they are in taking the customer's order. Paying for my food is also a struggle for ABP, as there always seems to be confusion about 1) which employee will ring up the food 2) which employee will put down their cell phone to ring up the food. If this was once or twice I would brush it off, not a big deal. I'm not exaggerating when I say this occurs every single day. Again, trying to find a cashier that will acknowledge and ring up my order is an issue, which is incredibly annoying. There are several nice employees at ABP, but unfortunately that doesn't seem to affect the behaviors of the ones who are not. While the management does seem to jump in and help out during a breakfast or lunch rush, it seems like they add more confusion than help. The terrible structure of this ABP location doesn't help much, considering there is nowhere for customers to wait after ordering a sandwich/salad/wrap.

But this is Chicago, a Midwestern city and this is as good as it gets if you get food during lunchtime in the loop. If you're going to complain about it then go to Thailand, you can't expect anything better at 12pm on a Monday. Also Orange Chicken is not a real Thai dish so of course it's going to suck if you get it especially considering the fact that it's been sitting in this steel container for five hours. Why would you do that to yourself? In fact it's not even a real Asian dish to begin with. Why they offer it then? For the Americans who like it. Should they? No, no one should. Whoever thought of mixing oranges and deep fried breaded chicken together is out of control.",3.0,0,0,0

I usually don't have time to leave the building during lunch and I'm known to have pad thai cravings. They were out of my go-to pad thai tofu in the cafeteria style warmers but said it would be up in 2 minutes. I decided to wait. I ordered it as the 1 entree + 1 side option and got the veggies and also ordered the chicken pot-stickers.They packaged up my veggies and pot-stickers and set it to the side. Well over 5 minutes later the pad thai was up. I asked for them to include limes but they only had lemons. I've had this substitution before and was not a fan so did not get them. Who serves pad thai without limes? They also don't add crushed peanuts. Since they had my container just sitting to the side, my potstickers were cold. The sauce was OK and probably saved them. The veggies were cold and not seasoned at all. Gross sums it up pretty well. Back to the pad thai. This is one of my favorite dishes and it's always my first order at any new-to-me  thai place. I made it through about half and had to stop because it just wasn't right. The tofu was slimy, some green onions were perfect and others looked like they were on round three  in the container. The noodles were really rubbery and the fish sauce was overwhelming (usually balanced with lime and peanuts) And this was a ""fresh"" batch. In total, my lunch was over $12 I may try this place again and order something different but it may be a while. When I want pad thai, I will go back to getting delivery from one of the much better places in the area.",1.0,2,0,0

Only management does), if the salad was correct because the menu on the board above the drinks did not list hummus as an ingredient. He said yes. Alrighty then, I believe you. I like hummus. I have never seen it on a salad, so what's wrong with a little extra fiber?Apparently everything. About an hour after I finished my salad (only ate half of the hummus because something was off), I was experiencing excruciating stomach pain.

And it's nice that the fillings stay in the bread instead of turning the roasted roll soggy and mushy.I'm taking two stars off for the lack of cleanliness.
